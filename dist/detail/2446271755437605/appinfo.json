I ended up even a little tired and needed a break from VR. This felt more immersive than any VR game I've ever played. The movie was actually 360° And I barely felt like I had enough time to see all the details in the scenes (like all the writings on the walls) before whe changed scenes again (which is a good thing! not boring!!), it had a suprising layer of interaction with objects  and you truely get a bond with the little girl and the enviroment. It was BEAUTIFUL, amazing style, amazing story, perfect combination between a story you're watching and yourself being IN the story at the same time. Sound and music is perfect too. I've watched it, and I'll watch it again and again and again whenever I feel like wanting to re-live this experience! \n\nFOR CHILDREN: Just so you know, I didn't expect this level of flashes and scary moments, it was a lot scarier than I expected (only around the end tho). For me it was perfect, goosebumps, adrenaline, confusion,.. I got sucked into the story. But I wouldn't recommend this as a story for small or sensitive children. Heh.\n\nI HOPE THESE MAKERS WILL MAKE MORE VR MOVIES/EXPERIENCES LIKE THOSE! I'D BUY!",
