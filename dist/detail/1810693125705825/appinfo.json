							"reviewDescription": "While an odd choice for a VR experience, Rush certainly is a fun one. The idea is that you dive and subsequently fall from planes, skyscrapers and mountain tops, with nothing but your squirrel-like wingsuit to help you glide through the checkpoints scattered above the forests and valleys below. Falling from a height in most games usually results in a little sickness, but Rush seems to avoid this side-effect, to the point that it actually feels pretty comfortable, despite what a certain part of your brain believes is happening.\n\n\nThe game, unlike any others we have played, offers 8 different control schemes, as well as a standing and sitting option – all of these will suit different people for different reasons and really helps you identify the most comfortable and enjoyable method of play to match your preferences. Each control option can be quickly tested in the tutorial and you can switch between sitting and standing before each race in the settings. The game looks great and seems to have a decent amount of content to keep you occupied, something a lot of specialised VR titles seem to lack.\n\n\nThe multiplayer seems busy for now and performs without a hitch. You begin suited up in the plane with a bunch of physics drenched toys to play around with together (basketballs, stacked cans, nerf guns etc) which keeps you entertained until more players join and the race starts, which is a nice quality of life addition for the future when multiplayer games might have longer lengths between them. Our main and only disappointment is that Rush seems to be somewhat of a one-trick-pony, the game is what it is and there isn’t much else offered. We’re not too sure how long the gameplay of Rush could keep you interested and for that it does lose a few points, but what we played we had little to complain about.\n\nRead the full review and more here: https://www.opiumpulses.com/article/310/10-oculus-quest-new-release-reviews-p2",
