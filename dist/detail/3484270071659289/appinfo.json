			"display_long_description": "Star Wars: Tales from the Galaxy's Edge is an action-adventure experience where you’ll travel to the planet Batuu and get caught up in your own unforgettable story. You’ll fight alongside classic characters like R2-D2 and C-3PO (Anthony Daniels), and face intimidating villains, like Guavian Death Gang cell leader Tara Rashin (Debra Wilson). Visit Seezelslak (Bobby Moynihan) in his cantina to pick up missions that will take you into the wilds of Batuu — or become part of an all-new tale alongside Jedi Master Yoda (Frank Oz) himself.\n\nThe experience takes place on the outskirts of Black Spire Outpost on the planet of Batuu, as depicted in Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge, the immersive epic lands at Disneyland Resort in California and Walt Disney World Resort in Florida. You’ll take on the role of a droid repair technician operating near the planet, but when a group of pirates attack you hit the escape pods and crash on Batuu, where you’ll discover that anyone in the galaxy can become a hero.",
