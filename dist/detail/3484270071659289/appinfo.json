You’ll fight alongside classic characters like R2-D2 and C-3PO (Anthony Daniels), and face intimidating villains, like Guavian Death Gang cell leader Tara Rashin (Debra Wilson). Visit Seezelslak (Bobby Moynihan) in his cantina to pick up missions that will take you into the wilds of Batuu — or become part of an all-new tale alongside Jedi Master Yoda (Frank Oz) himself.\n\nThe experience takes place on the outskirts of Black Spire Outpost on the planet of Batuu, as depicted in Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge, the immersive epic lands at Disneyland Resort in California and Walt Disney World Resort in Florida. You’ll take on the role of a droid repair technician operating near the planet, but when a group of pirates attack you hit the escape pods and crash on Batuu, where you’ll discover that anyone in the galaxy can become a hero.",

It’s not a bad game, there’s just a few things missing. \n1. I finished the entire game in like, 2 hours. The maps are really cool, and you get to shoot people,  but I was expecting more for $25.\n2. This game was very misleading. I thought this was the one with cool lightsaber fights and stuff, but it’s not. It’s still fun, but not as fun as I’d hoped.\nSo you can play it. There are some cool things you can do, for example, you find C3PO all damaged, and help him find his parts. He becomes your partner. That was cool. The rest of the game? Meh. I think you should play Vadar Immortal over this if you love Star Wars, or your trying to get into it. Vadar immortal comes in episodes that are only $10 a piece, and it’s a lot cooler. There are lightsaber fights and the force and it’s a lot more epic than this one. But that’s just my opinion.",
