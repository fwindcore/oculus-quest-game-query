							"reviewDescription": "Currently on a Quest 2, this game is almost unplayable. I’d say only 10% of the online games I play I can complete an entire mission. Often times controls are not responsive, other players voices cuts out, no one can hear you, or other players are no louder than the quietest whisper. This game is incredible for Star Trek fans like me, and is the epitome of a dream come true. However, it is nearly impossible to enjoy in its current state. In other recent reviews, I have seen Ubisoft support staff asking reviewers who have encountered these problems to record and document them, and send them over to be looked at and fixed. Instead of this since they’re not rare problems, Ubisoft should just play one game to diagnose these game breaking issues! Lastly, Ubisoft should stop giving Bridge Crew community members false hope for this game by continually saying they are fixing the issues. Either tell us this game is completely abandoned or  not, and quit giving the community false hope. Please Ubisoft, tell us what the situation is with the game. I can’t change my star review until this happens.\nUpdate: Upon seeing the quick response by Ubisoft staff to this review, I have updated my review to 3 stars. I was impressed by the promptness and in depth answer showing that the game is not abandoned. I hope these glitches and bugs get worked out quickly, and when they do I will again revise this review. Thank you Ubisoft and please fix these soon!",
