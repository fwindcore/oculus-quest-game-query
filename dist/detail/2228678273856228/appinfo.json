Gone are the days of watching a super-spy hero on-screen: by leveraging the head and hand-tracked capabilities of current VR technology, players can physically live out their 007 fantasies as the Espire Model 1 Operative. These stealth mechanics cannot be replicated on another medium. \n\nPlayers assume the role of an Espire Agent - a drone operator of the future. From the safety of their \"Espire Control Theatre\" (sized to their Oculus Guardian Boundaries) they deploy the Espire Model 1 operative on assignments around the globe. The player then remote-operates Espire 1 from thousands of Kilometres away - the player's movement is translated 1:1 into that of Espire.. The \"Control Theatre\" mechanic is not only a story component; it is used to minimize VR sickness whenever the player performs artificial movement.",

Now, guards will correctly spot the player’s hands if you’re using the hand-cams around a corner at close range to a guard!\n- Fixed an issue where enemy guards would not update their ‘perception component’ correctly. This reduces situations where enemies may spot the player at a glancing angle when they should not have\n- Fixed an issue where Enemies would say an incorrect voice line when discovering a knocked out ally, reporting the incident to their unit commander, and then waking up the ally.\n- Fixed an issue where dead/stunned hostages would appear to stand back up again after a period of time.\n- Fixed an issue where players could fall on the Jacobson (Destroyer) drone and ‘knock’ it out!\n\n**Crash Fixes**\n- Crash Fix: Fixed an issue where the game would become unresponsive if the player possessed an Espire unit while holding a weapon in their non-dominant hand.

Firstly thanks for taking the time to leave us such a positive rating and review and it's very humbling and awesome to hear Espire is your favourite game. :) We released way back in November 2019 and since then we've been working hard on introducing numerous bug fixes, improvements as well as additional content within the challenges section so rest assured new content within the challenges mode is something we've actively been doing over the months with the most recent additions coming in our very recent 1.8 spectre update we launched last week with two brand new challenges. In regards to the ending within the main campaign we're sorry you felt slightly disappointed however we can happily confirm a sequel is something we absolutely would love to develop at some point! There's nothing set in stone regarding timescales or official confirmation as to whether it will even happen but rest assured we definitely want to do it in order to continue the story. :) Stay tuned for more updates regarding this as well as any further content. Thanks for all the support and cheers for playing! :)",
