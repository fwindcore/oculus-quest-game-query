Gone are the days of watching a super-spy hero on-screen: by leveraging the head and hand-tracked capabilities of current VR technology, players can physically live out their 007 fantasies as the Espire Model 1 Operative. These stealth mechanics cannot be replicated on another medium. \n\nPlayers assume the role of an Espire Agent - a drone operator of the future. From the safety of their \"Espire Control Theatre\" (sized to their Oculus Guardian Boundaries) they deploy the Espire Model 1 operative on assignments around the globe. The player then remote-operates Espire 1 from thousands of Kilometres away - the player's movement is translated 1:1 into that of Espire.. The \"Control Theatre\" mechanic is not only a story component; it is used to minimize VR sickness whenever the player performs artificial movement.",

Now, guards will correctly spot the player’s hands if you’re using the hand-cams around a corner at close range to a guard!\n- Fixed an issue where enemy guards would not update their ‘perception component’ correctly.

							"reviewDescription": "Gotta say. This is one of the best games on the platform. It's a stealth shooter with climbing mechanics, decent physics, and an actual campaign.\n\nIt really feels great to play, and the seated support really works nicely. You can choose to play this game stealthily with a sleep dart pistol, or just run in with your loud weapons and shoot everything up. There are even a few voice commands that allow you to hold up enemies.\n\nEverything is very responsive, and the only thing I've seen an issue with is the climbing. Sometimes you can't quite do what you're looking to do, but it really doesn't happen too often.\n\nWeapons are fun to use, and aiming is made pretty easy. Planning your route is a lot of fun, and climbing up above enemies and dropping down to surprise them is super rewarding.\n\nAll in all it's definitely up there as one of the best games I've played in VR. No joke. It just gives you a lot of freedom and doesn't ever really get frustrating or overwhelming.",

Thanks for the super positive review and we're humbled you consider Espire to be one of the best games on the quest platform. :) We're pleased to hear you like the game and enjoyed the concept of having that freedom of deciding to tackle each situation or mission stealthily or from a more action based approach. :) it's great to see you like the voice commands too. Its a unique feature we're very proud of. :) In regards to climbing it can take a while to get familiar with it. There's a few neat tricks you can do while climbing such as launching yourself upwards or through the air. If you're climbing up for example and hold the grip button while dragging the motion controller down if you let go of the grip you can launch yourself upwards and the same can be applied going across too which can be convenient for reaching the higher and harder to reach places too. Thanks for all the support and we really hope you continue to enjoy the game. :)",
