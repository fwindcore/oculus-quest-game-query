With so many new users and coming on we put our focus on the new user experience for this update.\n\nNew Tutorials\nNew users will now begin their journey with a tutorial on the exerboard. From rendering modes to steering, this tutorial features everything you need to learn to get started in VZfit.  Additionally, we added video tutorials for some of the more advanced options in the game.\n\n\nNew Voice Over\nBoth the male and female coaches have had a voiceover update. We have also added multiple levels of voice over to suit your needs. Coaching mode is on by default and will offer you the most feedback on your ride.\n\nNew Continents Filter\nIn addition to the filters in last update we have now added a quick filter for toggling on and off specific continents. This can help you find a ride in a specific region and get you exploring faster!\n\n\nNew Store Items\nWe have added some more items to the store with a pretty great road warrior style jersey!\n\n\nIf you want to check out all the details be sure to visit our Updates page https://www.virzoom.com/2021/01/03/vzfit-update-january-2021/. We are off to a great start of the year and hope you are to!\n\nCheers and Happy Exploring!",

							"body_text": "Our December update is a huge one! With trainer updates, a massive UI overhaul and a ton of requested features.\n\nTrainer Update\nOur trainers have always been your riding buddy and helped push you a bit further, but we have given them a much needed upgrade.  In standing mode the trainer now has access to 50 new exercise's and in both modes you will see a graph for your progress in the training session!  Loop them for a never ending workout, or leave them unlooped to get a workout summary after each workout.\n\nIn Game Maps\n\nWho goes exploring without a map?  You now have the ability to pause at any point and see where you are in the world. Better yet, in the create ride screen you can pan across the entire planet and find a spot to start and end your ride by dropping pins.\n\nFind and Search Rides\n\nThe only thing better than creating your own rides is being able to find the amazing rides other people have made and shared. The new find ride interface makes this so much easier. Search for a ride by creators name or use the quick filters we have added to find your next adventure.\n\nNew Holiday Clothes\nWe have also added a new holiday set to the store so you can spread some joy in your very own ugly sweater jersey. \n\nThis and so much more is waiting for you in our December update. You can read the full update notes at https://www.virzoom.com/2020/12/14/vzfit-update-december-2020/  We can't wait to hear your feedback on the forums or our facebook group.\n\nCheers and best wishes for a happy Holiday season from our team to you!",

							"reviewDescription": "I understand this is a small team of developer. It’s a good idea, but using google maps as a foundation doesn’t work well. Everything is blocky and movement is clunky, even when it’s working at its best. Perhaps the team should focus on creating 5 to 10 of their own journeys that render properly. Maybe if this was a one time purchase, it would make sense. I’m not against subscriptions if there is enough value (I’m an active subscriber to Supernatural), but there is not enough value here for it to use a subscription model at all. I’ll commend the team for offering a 7 day free trial (and recommend they make it 30 days). I will also say I enjoy how movement works in the game, but without immersive environments it gets boring very quickly. Until they are able to build there own journeys or are able to render google street view images in a way that look like you are in that environment without the blocky weirdness I won’t be subscribing for $10 a month.",

So there are are a ton of people with lots of experience in the app posting their experience from pre-release.\nAfter the free trial you will still have access to the App and we rotate a free ride location every month so you can continue to check in as we make updates.\nIf you have a bike and sensor we do have fully immersive environments in VZPlay, which is included in the subscription, with games that do not utilize Google Street View. Also, you may enjoy comfort mode if the distortion bothers you. In this mode we do not 'move' you through the world but instead present you with clear undistorted images as you move. Thanks for giving it a try we really do appreciate it! If you have any more questions feel free to reach out to support!",
