							"body_text": "Wow!  What a week!?\n\nWe have been working on this release of VZfit for many months and it’s so exciting to have it out in the world and available for everyone to easily try. With the new standing mode feature and the ability to play the tutorial without an account we have had more people try VZfit in one week than we have had in the last 2 years!\n\nFrom new users to our long time veterans the response to the experience has been amazing. It’s truly inspiring to the team to know that we have helped you achieve your goals or provided a fun way to get more fit.\n\nFor us, it’s back to work though!  VZfit is a living, breathing product and we know that there is so much more that we can do to make it a better experience.\n\nFirst Update\nWhile overall the launch went smoothly we did find a couple of bugs that will be fixed in our first update. The most major of which is new users are currently not defaulting to auto-steering. This should be the default for standing mode and we want to make sure we get it fixed as soon as possible. In addition to that we do have one major feature that didn’t make launch and that is our achievement system.\n\nWe will be adding achievements to both VZfit.com and the Oculus system that will have some great long term and short term goals for you to shoot for.\n\nOur plan is to get this update released at the start of May and it should be going into testing next week!\n\n\n\nBeyond\nAs far as what comes after that?  We have some customization updates and avatar updates in the works and we should have more information on that once this first update goes out.  We will keep an eye on the feedback from new users and hope to hear from you all on what you love as well as what you think needs a little polish!\n\nOur team also wants to specifically thank our Facebook community for helping out with questions and support this week. The help has been invaluable for new users. If you are not a member of the VZfit community on Facebook we highly encourage it. They are a great group for inspiration, encouragement, and ideas. https://www.facebook.com/groups/vzfit\n\nThanks again to everyone who tried VZfit and be sure to keep checking in for regular updates.\n\nCheers and Happy Exploring!",

With so many new users and coming on we put our focus on the new user experience for this update.\n\nNew Tutorials\nNew users will now begin their journey with a tutorial on the exerboard. From rendering modes to steering, this tutorial features everything you need to learn to get started in VZfit.  Additionally, we added video tutorials for some of the more advanced options in the game.\n\n\nNew Voice Over\nBoth the male and female coaches have had a voiceover update. We have also added multiple levels of voice over to suit your needs. Coaching mode is on by default and will offer you the most feedback on your ride.\n\nNew Continents Filter\nIn addition to the filters in last update we have now added a quick filter for toggling on and off specific continents. This can help you find a ride in a specific region and get you exploring faster!\n\n\nNew Store Items\nWe have added some more items to the store with a pretty great road warrior style jersey!\n\n\nIf you want to check out all the details be sure to visit our Updates page https://www.virzoom.com/2021/01/03/vzfit-update-january-2021/.

							"reviewDescription": "I understand this is a small team of developers. It’s a good idea, but using google maps as a foundation doesn’t work well. Everything is blocky and movement is clunky, even when it’s working at its best. Perhaps the team should focus on creating 5 to 10 of their own journeys that render properly. Maybe if this was a one time purchase, it would make sense. I’m not against subscriptions if there is enough value (I’m an active subscriber to Supernatural), but there is not enough value here for it to use a subscription model. I’ll commend the team for offering a 7 day free trial (and recommend they make it 30 days). I will also say I enjoy how movement works in the game, but without immersive environments it gets boring quickly. Also the ‘comfort mode’ is deeply strange, not immersive and unusable. Until they are able to build their own journeys or are able to render google street view images in a way that look like you are in that environment without the blocky weirdness I won’t be subscribing for $10 a month.",

Also, you may enjoy comfort mode if the distortion bothers you. In this mode we do not 'move' you through the world but instead present you with clear undistorted images as you move.
