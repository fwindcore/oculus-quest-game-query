							"reviewDescription": "I have played a good amount of story games in my life, including VR ones, but this one was the best I have ever played. The other games never really made me feel absolutely immersed or emotional, but this one did it better than you could ever imagine. I felt like I was actually the main character, not just watching the game unfold beyond my eyes. When I first opened the game and got into my first Mech battle, what was happening on screen and the song playing really made me feel like it was all real. It made me feel that this is the game I have always wanted, instantly. I have no bad things to say about this game. If I am being honest, it changed my views on life in some ways. A remember twice in the game, I ended up crying. A lot. Games never usually do this, because the emotional attachment to the people and world around you aren't as displayed as they are in VR. In this, I felt like these were my dear friends. Honestly, this was worth 40$. I really hope the Devs continue to make games in this fashion,  be it a sequel, prequel, or a completely new story with new characters. I trust that they will only make masterpieces. I actually haven't played their first game, \"Tokyo Chronos\", and am planning on buying it as soon as I possibly can. I highly, highly recommend this. If you are into anime and dislike the world around you, get this game. Immerse yourself into *being* Chloe, if you will. And remember not to stop playing when the credits roll, there is a lot to see and experience.",
