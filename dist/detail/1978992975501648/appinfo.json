							"body_text": "I want to thank everyone in the SculptrVR community for their continued support, this is our first release in a long time and contains: new, higher quality graphics settings, multiplayer improvements - you can now ‘lock’ sessions and when a player is kicked from a session they will be unable to rejoin.\n\nOver the next few months we’ll be tackling more of our most requested features/improvements!\n\nIf you have ideas, you can join our Discord here:\nhttps://discord.com/invite/qEX5ZKG\n\nOr add to our ideas board by going here:\nhttps://sculptrvr.upvoty.com/\n\n\nOnce a Player is Kicked - they cannot rejoin!\nOne problem was unwanted players joining a session multiple times even after being kicked. Now, after a player is kicked, they will be unable to rejoin!\n\nLockable Multiplayer Rooms\nYou can now \"lock\" and \"unlock\" your multiplayer SculptrVR room to prevent/allow new players from joining.\n\nHigher Quality Graphics\nSculptrVR can show dramatically more polygons... at the cost of some dropped frames. We added a ‘Detail’ setting which can be used to seriously improve the visible mesh detail of your sculptures.\n\nTo change the detail: On SculptrVR’s hand menu, simply click the icon of a folder with a gear, and then choose ‘Settings’ -> ‘Detail’\n- Normal: Current default\n- High:  This setting might not be as smooth in all circumstances, but for most people it will be fine.\n- Too High: This setting is likely to show a lot of detail but likely to have poor performance on detailed scenes\n\nAnalytics\nGoogle Analytics for Firebase is now integrated\n\nBug Fixes\n- Export menu: Took out the word \"Tex.\" because it was likely to be misinterpreted as \"Texture\" rather than “Text.” (The FBX export option continues to use the ASCII text format)\n- The size of text on some buttons has been reduced to better fit inside the button.",
