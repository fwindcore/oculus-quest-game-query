Jump into a HIIT class and test your agility, endurance and reaction speed through guided workouts that will challenge you like no other home workout!\n\nBuilt from the ground up based on sports science, it takes inspiration from a fitness device used to help train F1 drivers, yet caters to all abilities and fitness levels.\n\nIn the same way that a HIIT class involves short bursts of intense activity to get your heart rate pumping, the HIIT studio will push you to your limit through a series of fast-paced cues that you smash as they light up around you.\n\nThink whack-a-mole, but on a totally different level: way more engaging, challenging and fun!\n\nBENEFITS\nApart from feeling amazing from the rush of endorphins that you’ll get post-workout, a HIIT class will help achieve a higher calorie burn, increased metabolic rate and improved oxygen consumption.\n\nOvertime, the health benefits include greater strength, speed and reaction times leading to an overall improved athletic performance.\n\nAVAILABLE AT LAUNCH\nHIIT is launching with 3 intro classes available to all regardless of whether or not you're a member.\n\nWe will then release new HIIT classes every week as part of our weekly schedule for those who have signed up for membership.",

In truth over 128 people combined have found this and earlier versions helpful.\n\nI hate it when devs convert one-time payment products into subscription services. I'm not going to stand for it.\n\nTO THE DEVELOPERS (UPDATE 5)\nWay to double-double-down in the wrong direction. You insult your original, rightfully unhappy, customers claiming they aren't \"real\" customers, now you're BRIBING people to increase your ratio of FAKE 5 star reviews. Perhaps it's time for trading standards to REALLY get involved.\n\nUPDATE 1\nI've contacted the CAB, they advise me that under UK law the developers CANNOT do this. They say:\n\n\"UK law states that digital content must match the description and functionality advertised on purchase. These rights come from the Consumer Rights Act 2015.\"\n\nThis should not have replaced BoxVR.\n\nUPDATE 2 \nI've reached out to Oculus asking them to remove this product from my account. I just want to end my relationship with this bad faith actor once and for all. Even when an expert has told them they're violating consumer rights and trading standards in their own country, they insist they aren't.  \n\nThis developer has abused their position on the Oculus store more than once and will continue to do so. \n\nUPDATE 3\nThis developer is now calling anyone posting public reviews not \"real\" customers. So instead of fixing the problems, they're insulting us. Steer clear of this \"game\". Don't make the same mistake we did here.\n\nUPDATE 4\nOculus have now told me they cannot remove products from accounts. They also won't refund because I bought when it was BoxVR. However, they did give me partial store credit as compensation.\n\nIf enough people ask for the same, maybe Oculus will be forced to improve how they handle this in the future.\n\nSteer clear of the fake 5* reviews. This developer is trying to scam you.",
