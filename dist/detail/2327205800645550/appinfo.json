							"body_text": "We at FitXR have big plans to build the most comprehensive virtual fitness club on the planet. And so we’re launching a bunch of major updates that we cannot wait for you to try.\n\nThe brand new features mean you will be able to workout with your friends via a new Multiplayer feature, have access to the full library of on-demand classes, take up fresh classes offered each day and enjoy original tracks from major and indie record labels. On top of this, we’ll also be launching our third fitness studio, coming very soon. So keep your eyes peeled for that!\n\nWhat’s new: key features\n\nWe’re extremely proud to have such a passionate community so we make sure we listen to our customers and use this feedback to continuously improve the FitXR experience. We believe the best way to do this is by constantly delivering fresh content and upgrades, so we’re excited to launch a new membership model, which is available from today on the Oculus Quest platform for $9.99 a month.\n\nTo thank our existing users for being such loyal fans, we’ll be giving them a 90-day free membership at launch, while new members will have access to a 7-day free membership trial. However, membership is completely optional so if you’re an existing user, you don’t have to sign up if you don’t want to - the app will stay as-is without you losing any previously purchased content and you’ll still get to enjoy multiplayer and some HIIT classes once they’re released.\n\nAs part of your membership, you’ll get:\n\n- A new class released every day\n- Multiplayer\n- Brand new studios — HIIT launching mid-May\n- Music from major and indie record labels\n- New Environments\n- Refreshed menu and easier navigation\n\nFitXR: A step above the rest\n\nFitXR was founded with a fitness-first mission; with an aim to make fitness approachable, and fun, for all. Since 2017, we have listened intently to you, our community, and constantly evolved the product based on your feedback. We’ve also invested all revenues back into development and plan to continue as such for the foreseeable future.\n\nWe believe that FitXR is the only at-home fitness product that delivers a unique blend of group fitness, gaming and immersion. All of this translates to an experience that feels more like play than what most people relate to with exercise. To quote one of our members, “it's the best thing to happen to exercise since exercise.”\n\nBy offering FitXR at the lowest subscription price currently available, we’re making it accessible to a broad range of members looking to have fun with their fitness. This is just one way in which FitXR delivers on its promise to bring an unrivaled fitness experience to all, a place where members can meet new people, work out together and achieve that real group, workout experience from the comfort of their homes.\n\nWe hope you enjoy the new updates and features as much as we do. We’re excited to hear from you!\n\nAll our best,\nSam & Sameer",
