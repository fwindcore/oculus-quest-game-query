							"reviewDescription": "Electronauts is a music-based game that gives you simple tools to remix and manipulate music on the fly without any musical talent or knowledge, which on the whole, it achieves incredibly well. You are given a choice of up to 80 songs that you can load up and play specific track sections, vocal verses and instruments. The tools at your disposal allow you to warp, loop or mix the audio at will, but it’s the orbs that we believe offer the most creative direction, acting almost as drum pads that play short audio samples that can be cut off early by hitting another orb, meaning you can, for the most part, play samples as slowly or quickly as you like to accompany the rhythm of the song.\n\nAfter finding songs that match your tastes and experimenting with different tools until you find the ones that are most enjoyable to you, its incredibly easy to get sucked into the moment and for a brief period, feel genuinely like you are creating unique and impressive soundscapes without any aid besides the backing track you have loaded in. Sometimes you’re so impressed with what you’re managing to achieve that you’re bummed you don’t have a real audience there to worship your newfound musical talent! There’s sadly not even a virtual one there to act like you’re their new idol. Graphically for the most part it does the job, but there are some close-up textures of speakers etc that just look straight up blurry.\n\nSadly, there is a pretty big omission in the Quest version of Electronauts, the complete lack of multiplayer. When there’s not even a record function in the game, it can be pretty lonely pretending to be a megastar DJ without a single person to share the experience, regardless of how much you’re smashing it – this is a large drawback and makes the game’s appeal feel dwarfed by its PCVR counterpart. We also kinda wish there was a 360 table option just for the fun of it!\n\nRead the full review and more here: https://www.opiumpulses.com/article/425/",
