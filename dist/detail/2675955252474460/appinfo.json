							"reviewDescription": "If you like any of those games BUY THIS NOW, and I'll tell you why..\n\nI feel like this is what we have here...\n\nThe battlefield is almost set up similar to league of legends. There's control points that you can get, and when you take them, the little bots in the sky will shoot at the enemy doing minimal damage. \n\nBut I'm getting ahead of myself. You basically have a number of cards in your hand, you can give them buffs which will give them pluses and minuses to their abilities. More armor, + less attack, that kind of thing.\n\nYou can craft new cards. And those will be what you play in your battle. the Yu-Gi-Oh aspect kind of reminds you of watching like the cartoon where when they play the cards the cards actually become alive and fight each other. So you're dropping your knights and your archers on the field of battle, giving them a waypoint, and then they will just walk forward and battle on their own.\n\nYou have two towers, and you have your headquarters, and there are pretty much three lanes roughly, just like league of Legends. But it is only one-on-one.\n\nThere's ground forces and air forces so you got to kind of battle with what is going to be best, and some troops can really do a lot of damage to other troops and vice versa.  You might have a Marauder that goes in and is wiping out a lot of other troops only to get shot once by a sniper and be dead.\n\nThe matches aren't super long, so you can get one in really quick, or you can play a bunch of them in succession.\n\nRight now there's two clans, but I noticed this game doesn't really rise to the top of the charts as far as visibility so you might not even know it's there. But if you see this review do yourself a favor and buy the game, and the more people that buy it, the more PVP that will happen, but for the meantime the AI matches are actually still very fun if you can't find someone to fight against. right now I'm playing mine on very hard and some of those I win and some of those I lose. \n\nI do think this game is worth it. I'm even willing to be patient and wait out more players to arrive.\n\nDEVELOPERS: If you read this, hopefully there are more cards coming than the list that are there now, there should be contests every month where new cards are released, and people have a chance to win them, otherwise they just go into the pool and people have a chance to buy them later..\n\nYou guys should send someone to scout out Horus Heresy Legions on Android and stick around for a couple of months to see how they do things. I think if you copy that model you'll be just fine.\n\nAlso, I think there needs to be a global chat feature built into this game. Also a guild chat feature. that's going to get people fired up in the game.\n\nAnyway, see you on the field!",
