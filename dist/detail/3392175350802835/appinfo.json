							"reviewDescription": "Probably the most diverse application of Quest hand-tracking out right now. Tracking can be a little flimsy at times, but that's probably due to the 'physics' element, my horrifying skeleton hands, and my messy workspace. I found that stretching a large, monochromatic blanket over shelves improved tracking somewhat. After playing, I was left with a strange sense of hand-motion-sickness. There's always been a delay to hand movement (and I think it's more noticeable on the original Quest), so if the technology were to develop any further, something a bit more instantaneous would help alleviate the floppy Surgeon Simulator feel. In the end, it's great to see the project get some structure and official recognition. (It could've done without the disappointingly familiar stock music though.)",
