							"reviewDescription": "Hand tracking has limitations on the quest so this game can’t really reach its full potential. So that part isn’t the games fault. If we ignore this I would’ve easily given it a 5 stars if it was  free as I don’t think the price justifies for the content. You’ll play this game for 10 minutes and then never touch it again. It’s just a cool presentation of what hand tracking can do but it’s no more than that. It’s a tech demo not a game, and I personally don’t think the price is right.\n\nHowever, the puzzles in the game are really fun and if you really think you’ll enjoy this game you might get a couple of hours of content out if here. \n\nGrind: If you want to unlock game modes for the sandbox mode you can play trough the puzzles and unlock stars which will then unlock new gamemodes in the sandbox mode\nReplayability: not really any replay value unless you want to collect all the stars and really like the puzzles\n\nThe game itself is good, but there isn’t much to keep you coming back for more which is understandable as this isn’t really a game and more of an experience. I would prefer if the game was free (I really want to support the devs but this is more of a showcase on what VR can do than something I’d pay for so idk.)\nI do recommend it especially if you’re interested in hand tasking. But the hand tracking isn’t the best and this isn’t the devs fault but the Hardware. \n\nI’ll give it a 7/10",

								"body": "Hi YucciBoi, thanks for your honest and detailed feedback!\n\nHand tracking is still currently the main factor that will influence the quality of your experience in Hand Physics Lab.\n\nThe quality of hand tracking heavily depends on the conditions of your environment, here are some tricks to optimize it:\n- Have good lighting in the room\n- No direct sunlight or glares from windows\n- Good contrast between the color of your hands and the background. \n- Keep both hands in the field of view and not obstructing one another\n- Try to not move your hands too fast in general\nHope this helps!\n\nThe way you will be able to unlock experiments in the sandbox will be improved in the next update and have a more satisfying progression system.\nA lot more content will be added in upcoming updates, stay tuned!",
