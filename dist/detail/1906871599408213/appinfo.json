							"reviewDescription": "This game has a fun sense of humor, from the robots saying things like \"BLUE SCREEN\" when you kill them or -- when you grab them -- \"WHY DID THEY ADD A HANDLE?\"  Also the robot manufacturer says things like any malfunction, from leaks to battery failure to homicide, are always the fault of the user, not the company.  \n\nGameplay is like a single-player arena combat game (think Gorn) and you can fight waves with weapons or grab your enemies, rip them apart, beat them and others with their own limbs, use the flying laser bots as laser guns, etc., but the fact they are robots and saying silly things as it happens makes it less horrific than it sounds.  \n\nOn the current setting (I'm assuming it has difficulty settings), the game is EXTREMELY casual, in that you never \"really\" run out of ammo (you do, but there's almost no point since you can drop your gun and grab another immediately from your holster) and it doesn't seem like you can die from taking damage, you can only fail from not meeting your objectives, which is A-OK in my opinion for a casual game like this.  I don't play Robo Recall Unplugged for a big challenge, just to smash stuff for a half hour at a time, and the game is great for that.\n\nSome reviews mention that it's short, but again, not a big drawback for me, as I only play for usually 30-minute bursts and don't really care much about progress; I'm in there to unleash some mayhem for awhile.\n\nLast point I'll make is the intro is really well done.  I won't spoil it, but it goes from being funny, to \"oh oh,\" to \"OH @#$%!\" in nothing flat.  After that, the game is all lighthearted blasting/smashing/throwing fun.",
