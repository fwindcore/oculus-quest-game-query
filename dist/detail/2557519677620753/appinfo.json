							"reviewDescription": "Don't laugh... newbie Quest user here, but it took me several attempts with the landing sim before I realised it's movement of the WHOLE hand controller that determines up/down/left/right direction of the shuttle and NOT the thumb joystick!!! I know, I know, should have gone to specsavers, as the intro notes do (sort of) explain this. However, I can only slap my forehead in disbelief and embarrassment now that I've actually managed to land the STS without severely damaging it on some occasions and destroying it on most. I'm sort of amazed that I managed to land it at all before realising the correct method to use, but I'll put that down to luck more than judgement. Now that I have understood the full briefing, I'm happy to say that this app is more enjoyable than frustrating and educational as well. I now have even more respect and admiration for the crews that flew these missions and for the engineers and many others responsible for building this amazing piece of technology! Why other app developers can't seem to create decent flight sims based on the same principles is the real shocker - come on people, where are they? I'm sure there's a gap in the market here. Decent flight simulators, whether for civilian or combat aircraft, are noticeable by their absence in the Oculus Quest store. Surely someone can come up with something better than 'Ultrawings' for chrissake? Would like to see more interaction available during take-off, but it's good to enjoy the ride as well! Need a 4.5 star option available, as it's more than a 4 but not quite a 5 in my book....",
