I have had this game for close to a week now and I have been playing a decent amount during these times. This game has some pros and many cons.\n\nPROS\n\n- The one thing I absolutely LOVE about this game is the ability to upgrade your town. This adds so much to work up to in the game.\n\n- I also love the ability to drive/operate a train and go other places to mine.\n\n- The mining details and animations are on point.\n\n- I like that this game has a semi wide variety of items. Not much and not little, but is fine.\n\n- I also love the radio because it gives you some sort of purpose for why you need to mine .\n\nCONS\n\n- The cave details are not good. While the overall detail is a tiny bit below par for the city and elevator, the cave’s details are gross. All the walls not including the mineable rocks are just blobs of grey color. \n\n- Why is there a time limit on your mining? Although it is manageable mining with the “infinity gauntlet”, you have to swing your fist in the air so much. However when mining with the pickaxe you feel so rushed to be finished and throw everything in that little bucket thing in the center of the elevator.\n\n- Glitches. There is one glitch that I cant across MANY times which makes it basically impossible to proceed. When mining after finding four of the five diamond things to put on your fist. you come across a fifth. When the fifth is finally on your hand everything darkens out and you are supposed to smash the earth with that fist. This was all very random because when it is open it looks like the inside of a watermelon! Shortly after the screen darkens again then you go to some sort of end scene where there is an old radio saying a bunch of stuff like this is the end of the game and more. You stay there for around five minutes doing nothing then you finally get teleported back. I had to go through this countless times because when I was mining it keeps coming up.\n\n-There needs to be a bigger variety of pickaxes. The swinging pickaxe that you buy is actually not better than the one you start with.\n\n- The inventory system needs to change. Although I like the hooks to put stuff on, five slots is just not enough for the amount of things you can buy. Also with the inventory being five little circles on your waist, it takes at least 20 seconds to put something there. Once they are and you try to pick something up from the floor by bending down, you will grab one of the items in your inventory instead. This is pretty frustrating given that you are on a short time limit and your are panicking trying to get all the gold and whatever you mine into the bucket thing. Now talking about the hooks, they are pretty useful but sometimes a pain to hang stuff on.\n\n- Movement. I like that you can teleport around and walk around. But, the walking is just too fast. you touch the joystick slightly and you are at the other side of the elevator. It needs to be slower that’s all.\n\nThank you for reading this far into my review and I hope to see at least some of these suggestions put into place! This game has a LOT of potential and I am really excited to see what will be done with it as time goes on.\n\n\nSide note, I will be updating this list soon once I am able to explore the other half of the game, like using the train to go to different locations.", "reviewTitle": "Cave Digger", "review_helpful_count": 178, "review_rank_by_viewer": null, "date": 1594063201, "developerResponse": null}}]}, "can_viewer_review": false, "is_offer_region_restricted": false, "__isWithWebsitePageMeta": "Application", "website_page_meta": {"description": "Cave Digger is a mining adventure game, which takes place in a small town of an alternative Western universe full of mystery, dark humor and full of experimental tools for the brave miners!\n\nGear up to explore the town and the depths of the mountain.
