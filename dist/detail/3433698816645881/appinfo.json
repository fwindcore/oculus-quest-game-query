Travel amongst them, learn new spells, and uncover the secrets of this strange world to orchestrate your escape.\n\nFlow Weaver is a narrative escape room game. The player explores and experiments with their environment, moving between different magical dimensions to solve intuitive puzzles towards the goal of escape.\n\nGameplay allows you to move between your cell and multiple different dimensions (or \"Flows\") as you discover them, learning how each Flow affects the world in different ways. The player uses those differences to solve puzzles and challenges, learn new skills or spells, and uncover new objects and new puzzles. \n\nFlow Weaver is an immersive seated experience with fully voiced dialogue, a moving soundtrack, and rich narrative lore for fantasy fans to dig into.\n",

New installs should see an improved experience!\n\nUpdates in this patch include:\n- Can now skip voice lines by pressing in the Left Thumbstick (Caution there is no way to replay voice lines. Only use when you need to speed through sections of the game you’ve already played)\n- Bringing wine to faeries glitch some users experienced has been fixed\n- Acorn will now remain planted in patch of dirt\n- Improved meditation signals in Underworld\n- Skybridge Bird’s flight path can no longer be accidentally interrupted by player\n- Meditation glitch during tutorial progression has been fixed\n- Material World runestone will now return to player\n\nKnown issues that we have flagged as priorities and are continually working on:\n- Save points in the game could be more clearly communicated. Players may need to repeat game progress from the last save point\n- Runestones are not linked to your save points and must be retrieved upon reload\n- Skybridge runestone cannot be retrieved a second time\n- Purple Bauble can be permanently lost if a player throws it off the level",
