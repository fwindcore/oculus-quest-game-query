The player uses those differences to solve puzzles and challenges, learn new skills or spells, and uncover new objects and new puzzles. \n\nFlow Weaver is an immersive seated experience with fully voiced dialogue, a moving soundtrack, and rich narrative lore for fantasy fans to dig into.\n",

							"body_text": "We’ve been working hard on your feedback and addressed issues discovered by some of our players. The most important one of all is that the game SAVES your progress much more often which means almost every completed puzzle will stay solved when you return. This improvement and skipping lines with the left thumbstick will go a long way for players who prefer multiple play sessions.\n\nUpdates in this patch include:\n\n- All Runestones and most placed objects stay in place when loading saved states\n- Player-view will now be re-centered automatically if you have to take a break and remove your headset\n- Runestones can no longer be grabbed a second time after being released in the Material World\n- Commune Spell can no longer be accidentally skipped. Fireflies will now stay visible until the spell is learned\n- Amended order of interactable events in Skybridge. The pink bird will no longer spawn until the player meets the Necromancer in person\n- Purple bauble now stays in Material World where it cannot be destroyed\n\nKnown issues that we have flagged as priorities and are continually working on:\n\n- Acorn resets its growth but works correctly if you only flow between Material World and Feylands.\n- Ectoplasm can separate from the bowl when you reload the game. They go back together again though!",

New installs should see an improved experience!\n\nUpdates in this patch include:\n- Can now skip voice lines by pressing in the Left Thumbstick (Caution there is no way to replay voice lines. Only use when you need to speed through sections of the game you’ve already played)\n- Bringing wine to faeries glitch some users experienced has been fixed\n- Acorn will now remain planted in patch of dirt\n- Improved meditation signals in Underworld\n- Skybridge Bird’s flight path can no longer be accidentally interrupted by player\n- Meditation glitch during tutorial progression has been fixed\n- Material World runestone will now return to player\n\nKnown issues that we have flagged as priorities and are continually working on:\n- Save points in the game could be more clearly communicated. Players may need to repeat game progress from the last save point\n- Runestones are not linked to your save points and must be retrieved upon reload\n- Skybridge runestone cannot be retrieved a second time\n- Purple Bauble can be permanently lost if a player throws it off the level",

							"reviewDescription": "Love the idea of fantasy-themed escape room puzzles, but some of these challenging puzzles demand you to think outside the box to solve them. There were few moments where I wished to have gotten more clues for the puzzles. Frankly, the puzzles test your patience and cause some frustration, but the seated experience makes it a bit better to think through them. \nThe visuals are beautifully designed and the flows are atmospheric especially the Skybridge. Enjoyed the entire gameplay which took me approximately 3-4 hours to solve. There are some bugs in between, but it resolves when you start the game again.\nOverall, the game demands a lot of thinking to solve the puzzles which I totally loved. The visuals are compelling. Would have given a 5 star if there were more clues to solve the puzzles. \nBut if you seek a challenge, definitely try this one. It's worth the price.",
