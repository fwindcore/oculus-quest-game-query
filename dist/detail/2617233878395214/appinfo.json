Compared to the regular levels, the ones in the Freestyle Expansion Pack have no checkpoints and completing them without chalk will get you bonus points. We’re also introducing rhythm-based climbing where you’ll see disappearing grips along your route, requiring you to learn the grip patterns to the beat of a background track to progress through.\n\nYou will unlock each of the 6 levels step by step, and once all are completed you will receive an exciting new glove as a completion reward.\n\nFinally, Client Update 1.1. includes general bug fixes. We will be monitoring closely what is said, and we will make it to a point to address issues you might encounter as soon as possible.\n\nMajor known issues of this update:\nThe game might shut down and restart when returning from Oculus menu (note this is a OS related issue nothing we on the dev side can fix)\n\nUI breaks when starting a Ghost Race without having a connection to server\n\nStay healthy, and have fun scaling new heights!",
