Things might get heated but always work together as a Spaceteam!\n\nThe ship's computer is out of control, your only chance of surviving longer than one sector is to shout technobabble at your friends!\n\nTry to follow the randomly generated, incorrectly assigned, sometimes impossible to pronounce instructions and steer your ship out of the path of a supernova.\n\nComplete enough instructions successfully and you will progress to the next sector, each more difficult and so the ship becomes harder to control. Dodge asteroids by shaking your maracas, clean up alien goop and disco dance like your life depends on it!\n\nWays to play:\n\nVR MULTIPLAYER\n\nUp to 6 players, in any popular VR headset join in a co-op game trying to avoid their inevitable doom.\n\nFACE TO FACE\n\nUp to 6 players with at least 1 headset and connected smart devices, this feels much like the original Spaceteam game.\n\nSINGLE PLAYER\n\nIn Practice Mode your Spaceteam will be 2 of our trusty robots!",

Playing in a multiplayer game will unlock our new Black/Pink uniform combo, and for any players who reach sector 5 (it's really quite easy), you will unlock our Orange/White Commander's Uniform. Once unlocked, these are yours to keep!\n\nAs an added bonus, all players will also have access to our new playable alien species, pictured below. You will be able to select this look from May 21st onwards, even if you don't manage to make it to our birthday weekend event.\n\nBalloons!\n\nWe've added some party balloons around the bridge of the ship, just to mark the occasion.\n\nKeep your eyes open for some exciting announcements coming from the Spaceteam Crew over the next few days - we have lots to talk about in the very near future!\n\nSee you on the bridge, and remember.......... work together as a space team!\n\n\n",

I can play in English but French is my 1st language and the iOS French version is sooooo hilarious. \nDevelopers please translate tout game on the Qu’este too",
