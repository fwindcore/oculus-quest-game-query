You get two people or three people or four people playing it, yet it's a multiplayer game, and it's co-op, so you won't really feel like throwing the headset across the room when you lose like in PVP.  Well, you might (#$@& flying saucers!!)\n\nI haven't played with a six-man team yet, but I can imagine the chaos that would ensue and how absolutely a blast it would be. There would literally have to be some sort of organizational thing going on. People shouting over each other trying to get the commands out, things catching on fire, switches breaking, someone's voice sounds like they did a bunch of helium and are talking really fast and you have no idea what they're saying, the other dude's head is gigantic and he's talking really slow with a Wooommp kind of tone to his voice. People trying to figure out how to pronounce the words for the commands that you're telling other people.. honestly, it's like a board game, in a way, come to life.\n\nAlso, it's a puzzle game. Let's face it, if you like puzzle games and you like challenges, and you like to play with your friends, or you like to play with other people (with puzzle games) (get your mind out of the gutter) then this is pretty much a win-win situation. I think what people need to do when they play this game is friends list everybody that you play with and start getting groups going on on a daily basis.\n\nStop listening to these little kids that can't wait 5 minutes for someone to show up and play with them and so they leave and then write a bad review.\n\nIt's like Anthony Bourdain when he talks about yelp. Look up the YouTube video, he says that yelpers are the worst human beings on Earth because they leave bad reviews for the wrong reasons and ruin restaurants. \n\nI promise you, get this game, have your friends or family get this game, you can even play it if you have a group of people in the same room, one person jumps on the VR headset and the rest of the people can play it from their phone.\n\nObviously it's going to be even better if you're one of those Rich families where everybody has a headset LOL.\n\nOh, and I'll tell you what, if you get this game, send me a friend request, I'll accept it, then send me a chat message and tell me you bought the game, and I'll find time to jump in with ya.\n\nDo it!
