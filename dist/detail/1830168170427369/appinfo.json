							"reviewDescription": "I canceled my gym membership at planet fitness for this. I used to do the beachbody programs when I was younger and I could always stay dedicated and lose weight and tone up. I'm 32 now and had been battling with depression and anxiety, the pandemic certainly didn't help and I gained about 70 pounds. I was the biggest I had ever been. Beachbody programs couldn't keep me motivated anymore. Felt like a chore and I'd often talk myself out of it. I purchased an Oculus Quest 2 in January of this year. And as soon as I played this I feel in love. I have never sweated so much in my life! Not even running on the treadmill at PF. I was playing and hours would go by and the whole time I'm doing HIIT, squats, lunges, my shoulders, biceps, triceps, everything would be on fire but I was just having so much fun! It's been 2.5 months and I have lost so many inches off of my body! My husband's noticed along with family and friends. I just added in some weight training at home and I am hooked. My mood has improved and the meditation is also another amazing benefit to this app! The locations, incredible, trainers, epic, the benefits...just insane! I think it's worth $19 a month. I'm actually purchasing it for a year next month. I'm addicted and I'm so happy with how it's making my arms and body look. I'm so much stronger for everyday things and I don't get out of breath. I have more energy. And when people ask me what I'm doing, I get say Supernatural on VR. It's hilarious to see people's faces üòÇ",
