							"reviewDescription": "So far I'm really enjoying the workouts.  The scenery is beautiful and I understand that's part of what you pay for. But let's be honest, although this is a large initial fee, the scenes are then used in multiple workouts so it's not an ongoing cost. The other cost the developers refer to are the trainers that \"guide\" you through the workouts. I'd use the term \"guide\" loosely because the warm up and cool down are a couple of minutes long and can be used for any of the workouts, and most of the talking during the workouts has nothing to do with the workout. It's canned motivational speech telling you how great it is that you showed up or comments about the songs with the occasional \"get low into these triangles\" and \"keep those arms straight\" ,thrown in. To be honest after the first week, I (like many people) think the trainers are more of a distraction and annoyance than anything else. Admittedly some are more annoying than others.  I really, really want to be able to mute them, not just turn them down. If the workout for the day is not something you want to do then you have to go back in to a previous workout and hear the same thing all over again. Ugh! Make it stop! I haven't decided yet if I will continue after the 30 days at the $20 price point. Probably not but I may consider it, only if they add a mute button.",
