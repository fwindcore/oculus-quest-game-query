So a faster CPU, GPU and more RAM mean we can share a lot of things we built for the Rift instead of the Quest.\n\nYes, Quest 2 is that powerful!\n\n\n\nDon‚Äôt take our word for it, check out this comparison video between Oculus Quest 1 vs Quest 2 above or view it on YouTube here. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuKbkn0Mg6U\n\nOverview of the visual upgrades for Dash Dash World:\n- All new lighting\n- Native 90hz for smooth graphic\n- Sharper corner by eliminating foveated rendering\n- Anisotropic Filter reduces jagged edges and improves the overall quality\n- Improved particle effect\n- Improved Texture quality and resolution\n- Improved 3D Models\n- Sharper graphic resolution\n- [New] Extra special effect\n- [New] Redesigned car dashboard*\n*Improvement will also be available on the Oculus Quest 1.\n\n\n\nWe also use this opportunity to polish and enhance other visuals for an even more immersive and fun experience, all cross platform play.\n\nOculus Quest 2 with XR2 chipset is a generational leap and will provide better graphics despite it having to handle much more pixels and frames per second.\nThis free enhancement update will even bring some of these graphical improvements to users on the Quest 1 on the 18th of December.\n\n\n\nAlong with this big 2.0 update, you will be able to play up to 8 players with new and easy immersive driving methods, more career campaigns and 2 new tracks!\nWe will also introduce a new Season 1 tournament and new track which start from December 2020 to February 2021 with free unlockables and more.

Let me explain.\n\nThis game can and will be improved. However, it has everything you need to enjoy playing VR comfortably installed in your chair.\n\nI am not a big lazy guy but i also know that VR sessions can be very tiring so the gametime is physicaly limited. However with this game you can play comfortably sitted and remains fully immersive. In fact it is more immersive to be sitted.\n\nThere are many cosmectics, weapons and they recently improved graphics & performance with two new tracks.\n\nFrequent updates, solid base & great ambitions such as becoming the VR kart game reference.\n\nThis game is not perfect but it has EVERYTHING you need to enjoy playing VR while drifting, shotting, throwing things... \n\nDrift is the Key by the way. ;)\n\nConclusion: JUST BUY IT\n\nA few things that needs to be improved in my opinion:\n-lobby interaction is broken (Other's people moves looks weird)\n-Engines needs to be balanced in order to handle harder Track such as Volcanic Jungle and even more to be able to drift on all the maps.\n-Poison/Hack needs to be reduce because it can break a perfect run & let you loose even if you were ahead from far.  It is a great Weap btw but too powerfull in my opinion.\n-Need to be much much more known by VR community ;)",

This change drastically in the Pro racing mode and everything becomes crazy. You will need to master every corner with a drift and brake combination. We still discuss this internally if we have gone too far on the difficulty of the game.\n\nWe already changed the drop rate of the Hacker recently but we could consider to nerfing it too.\n\nAnd we definitely agree on your last point ;)",
