							"reviewDescription": "TRIPP is an interesting idea, and I'd love to use it... I  might even pay for it... except this one little thing:\n\nTRIPP suffers from an issue I've found in a few VR apps.  You are expected to sit up and look forward.  Period.  At Attention, Soldier!\n\nSometimes, I enjoy my Quest and VR experience while simply relaxing and lounging in bed.  I do not wish to sit at attention or have to look forward.  I wish to look up.  I'm relaxing.  I'm in bed.  My head will be pointed at the ceiling... but in VR, it doesn't have to be this way.\n\nI  have noticed that the developers of some apps have conquered the technology of being able to have the user orientated in any direction, and the app will adapt to this.  YouTube VR is a great example, and I think a couple of others do this too.  Sadly, TRIPP, which is meant to be a meditation app (ie relaxing), won't allow this.\n\nMy experience is literally... I'll start the app and realize, I can't access menus (or ANYTHING) unless I orient my face to look downward or straight ahead.  Then I just close the app and say, \"yeah, no\" and give up on it.\n\nI'd appreciate the developers to research and implement the technology that would enable a user to access everything, from beginning to end, in which ever head orientation the user chooses... including relaxing, in bed, while looking up.\n\n*** UPDATE ***\n\nAs the developer indicated, Tripp DOES have a “Recline Mode,” but this seems only available AFTER you sign up and purchase a membership, and cannot be seen while in demo mode.  Had I known this, I’d probably have signed up sooner, but was judging by what I saw, functionally, in demo mode",
