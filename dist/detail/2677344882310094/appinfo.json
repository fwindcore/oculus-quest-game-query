Experience a first person shooter as you never have before: Onward combines mil-sim gameplay with the experience of playing in virtual reality. Players cannot rely on crosshairs or mini maps, instead you rely on coordination and communication with your squad in order to succeed at your objective. Realistic combat mechanics and artificial locomotion will push your combat survival skills to their limit as you engage in infantry combat across a large variety of maps and combat situations.\n\nOnward features a wide variety of solo, coop and competitive game modes. Take to the online battlefield and join your friends in cross-platform combat in a high stakes clash with up to ten people and best your opponents on a strategic and tactical level in an Uplink or Assault match, chase down AI bots in a Hunt mission or wait for extraction as waves of enemies approach you during an Evac mission. The only way is Onward.",

							"body_text": "\n\nHello everyone!\n\nWe are pleased to announce that the time for the 1.8.7 update is now! This update is primarily focused on audio upgrades and the re-release of the Snowpeak map, but also contains a lot of bug fixes and general improvements.\n\nOur audio improvements comprise amongst many other things gunshots that are more consistent in their quality, more immersive and directional footsteps, higher quality voice chat, more immersive environmental sound, and more consistency between the volumes of different sources. Two new features for audio are the ability to independently adjust the volume of gunshots and voices, and audio mixing presets to select.\n\nEnjoy those updated audio sounds while playing again on the re-released Snowpeak map (day and night versions available!) and hear the crunch of the snow under your feet as you tactically sneak around on the ice to get that perfect shot in as you notice the other team coming your way. Snowpeak features long distance engagement and close quarter combat options. This map will test your skills in stealth and tactical abilities.\n\nSmoke grenades have also been reworked. They have changed to spherical from the previous comic spray to allow them to be used in a more predictable way which benefits gameplay. Full screen tint will be more accurately bound to the area of the smoke, and is harder to see through. We have also fixed an issue where AI wasn’t affected by smoke grenades and could ‘see’ players as usual. Finally and perhaps most importantly scopes no longer fully tint when looking at smoke grenades, allowing you to see players in front of the smoke through scopes once more.\n\nUpdate 1.8.7 is available now and will download automatically. Enjoy!",

							"reviewDescription": "This game is very well built theres no bugs i encountered before, I’ve never met an exploiter and the community for the most part is pretty chill besides in the shooting range its a little tough to find a decent server. The recoil from the guns are somewhat accurate for the most part some guns have manual reload and some you just press a to drop the mag and put a new one in. Although the kids that play this game are overall annoying they tend to draw genitals on the map board in every server i see a kid in so try to avoid those but overall get the game if you like gun games you will most likely enjoy it",
