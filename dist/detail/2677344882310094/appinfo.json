Experience a first person shooter as you never have before: Onward combines mil-sim gameplay with the experience of playing in virtual reality. Players cannot rely on crosshairs or mini maps, instead you rely on coordination and communication with your squad in order to succeed at your objective. Realistic combat mechanics and artificial locomotion will push your combat survival skills to their limit as you engage in infantry combat across a large variety of maps and combat situations.\n\nOnward features a wide variety of solo, coop and competitive game modes. Take to the online battlefield and join your friends in cross-platform combat in a high stakes clash with up to ten people and best your opponents on a strategic and tactical level in an Uplink or Assault match, chase down AI bots in a Hunt mission or wait for extraction as waves of enemies approach you during an Evac mission. The only way is Onward.",

							"body_text": "Hello Everyone!\n\nAs you may have guessed when we announced that we were joining Oculus Studios back in late April it’s been a crazy month of May for us. It was heartwarming to see the largely positive response to the news!  We, like you, are excited for what this means and the future opportunities we will have. That's for the future, back to current events: we've been working on 1.8.8 for a long time, and we're excited to get it into your hands very soon. The release of 1.8.8 also clears the path for more frequent updates with more content and new features for you to enjoy.\n\nFrom The Devs’ Desk\nTo give a quick recap and update of the roadmap we set out in the previous sitrep: Update 1.8.8 is coming out soon, and we’re currently tackling the final list of issues before we send a build over to Unit 51 for testing and ultimately release it to you. Update 1.8.8 will focus on a rewrite of key game systems to make them future-proof and increase their stability so that we can build on them going forward. On top of that, Update 1.8.8 includes a night version of the shooting range map and a lot of bug fixes, including a fix for the crash on Quest that happens when there is too much writing on the white board.\n\nAfter 1.8.8 is released, we intend to release two more updates in quick succession: update 1.8.9 will feature the Abandoned map in both day and night variants, and Update 1.8.10 will see the release of the Turbine map, also in day and night variants.\n\nAs Abandoned is coming together we want to share a few teaser images with you.\n\nAbandoned is situated in a Siberian forest close to a lake. With several Soviet-era buildings and factories, VOLK has repurposed these facilities in order to assemble weapons and vehicles. A MARSOC Chinook has been shot down and looted by VOLK militia. With months’ worth of gathered intelligence, MARSOC is well prepared for an offense to take out this facility. A recon mission was cut short when a Chinook transporting MARSOC troops was shot down over an unmapped forest. The remaining Marines have gathered near an abandoned industrial complex. Intelligence has confirmed VOLK forces in the area.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut that’s not all to look forward to: although we’re not sure yet if it’ll be ready in time for 1.8.9 or if it will be released with 1.8.10, we are working on improving our weapon systems, adding the ability to perform an HK slap and speed reloads for weapons that realistically support such specific interactions. At the same time, we will also remove bolt release buttons from weapons such as the MP5 which do not have these features in real life. A full list of what guns will be getting these features will be made in the patch notes when the feature is released.\n\nOur plans for the longer term also remain unchanged: we’ll be working on Shadowmask Lighting to improve graphics on PC, all new and improved animations for characters, a friends and party system to quickly join up in a game with the people you want to play with, and a progression system to keep an eye on your battlefield performances! It’s a bit early to talk about any of these in detail, but definitely keep an eye on future Sitreps for the juicy details.\n\nCommunity Center\n\nSummer Fun is coming! We are gearing up for a Summer Community Contest so be on the lookout for more details soon.\n\nThis month we want to highlight a member of our community who has been providing some fun Onward videos on his YouTube channel. Not only does he highlight some great sniper shots and gameplay, but some great moments within their community of players.\n\nThis video in particular gave us a few laughs\n\nThat's it for May's Sitrep, and as always: stay frosty!",

							"title": "Onward 1.8.7 is available now!",
							"created_time": 1610486978,
							"body_text": "\n\nHello everyone!\n\nWe are pleased to announce that the time for the 1.8.7 update is now! This update is primarily focused on audio upgrades and the re-release of the Snowpeak map, but also contains a lot of bug fixes and general improvements.\n\nOur audio improvements comprise amongst many other things gunshots that are more consistent in their quality, more immersive and directional footsteps, higher quality voice chat, more immersive environmental sound, and more consistency between the volumes of different sources. Two new features for audio are the ability to independently adjust the volume of gunshots and voices, and audio mixing presets to select.\n\nEnjoy those updated audio sounds while playing again on the re-released Snowpeak map (day and night versions available!) and hear the crunch of the snow under your feet as you tactically sneak around on the ice to get that perfect shot in as you notice the other team coming your way. Snowpeak features long distance engagement and close quarter combat options. This map will test your skills in stealth and tactical abilities.\n\nSmoke grenades have also been reworked. They have changed to spherical from the previous comic spray to allow them to be used in a more predictable way which benefits gameplay. Full screen tint will be more accurately bound to the area of the smoke, and is harder to see through. We have also fixed an issue where AI wasn’t affected by smoke grenades and could ‘see’ players as usual. Finally and perhaps most importantly scopes no longer fully tint when looking at smoke grenades, allowing you to see players in front of the smoke through scopes once more.\n\nUpdate 1.8.7 is available now and will download automatically. Enjoy!",

The recoil from the guns are somewhat accurate for the most part some guns have manual reload and some you just press a to drop the mag and put a new one in. Although the kids that play this game are overall annoying they tend to draw genitals on the map board in every server i see a kid in so try to avoid those but overall get the game if you like gun games you will most likely enjoy it",
