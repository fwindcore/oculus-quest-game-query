			"display_long_description": "How long have these goggles been pressing into my flesh? What began as a small game jam between William Pugh (The Stanley Parable), Dominik Johann (Minit) and Justin Roiland (Rick and Morty) is now—two years later—an aberration of warped technology, weird worlds and strange, disturbing creatures. Since its debut, Accounting has tripled in size, mutated into an intricate labyrinth of forbidden virtual realities. With countless more secrets to discover if you have the stomach to brave the dangers of new characters brought to life by a cast of comedic legends (Rich Fulcher, Reggie Watts, and Justin Roiland). DANGERS - If you die in VR, you die in real life. - Do not play after midnight. - Achievements linked to unforgivable acts of human corruption. - A way better soundtrack than a VR game soundtrack has any right to be. - Subtitles and translations for 9 languages. Wow, internationally dangerous! - The vacuum of space. Yeah that dangerous. - And unfortunately: The Cops.",

							"reviewDescription": "Most likely not what you’d expect from the name, even if you’re not expecting a straight-up accountant simulator. Accounting+ has much more in common with titles like Virtual Virtual Reality and Bonfire than it does with a game like Job Simulator (what we expected going in). The game relies a lot more on the comedy of each scene’s narration than it does with its limited gameplay, with each section providing a uniquely odd and progressively adult experience that continuously takes you off guard.\n\nThe narration of the introduction area is delivered with the sass of titles like Elevator to the Moon but with the dry, deadpan silliness that only British-born minds can muster. Much of the game involves you doing next to nothing whilst you listen to crazy, eccentric characters talk absolute nonsense – which is so well written and performed you stay listening until there’s absolute silence so that you don’t miss anything. The game is so evidently inspired by Rick and Morty and even references it several times, which if you’re a fan, isn’t necessarily a bad thing – I laughed out loud at least 5 times during my first hour spent in the world of Accounting+. The first 15 minutes of narration is flawlessly funny and a rare type of humour, even when compared to similar titles, but the Rick and Morty inspiration also draws some negatives to the title.\n\nEventually, the narrator asks you to pick your favourite of three Ricky and Morty memes, describing each one as if memes actually offer opportunity for intellectual thought around their meanings, you can tell at this point that the narrator is serious, he genuinely loves these memes. If you’re past the age of 30 you’ll likely cringe all the way through this part as you feel yourself connect less and less with the “comedy” that started off so strong. After this it goes from strength to strength.\n\nRead the full review and more here: https://www.opiumpulses.com/article/315/10-oculus-quest-new-release-reviews-p3",
