							"reviewDescription": "The 1969 mission to land on the moon is one of human kind’s greatest achievements and John F Kennedy’s inspirational speech to accompany it is my all-time personal favourite presidential speech. Apollo 11 VR is designed to take you on a journey through that mission from the astronauts' launch to their return home to Earth. The game starts off showing extensive video from Kennedy’s speech and the launch in a 60’s attired living room - an awesome experience that really shows how lucky those living in the 60s were to have witnessed such an important moment for science and mankind. The few things that Apollo 11 on the Quest gets right are that it provides a base experience and lesson for those who want to know more about the iconic mission and allows those that lived in that moment a chance to reminisce and see the event through different eyes.\n\nBefore we get into the negatives, one thing that may just be personal preference but one that I think is worth mentioning is the music, while there is nothing fundamentally wrong with it, I just think it’s unnecessary and actually breaks immersion in a big way. The nervous dialogue between the astronauts and ground control, the endless beeping of the rocket dashboard and the roaring blast from the take-off itself create enough powerful atmosphere without borderline cheesy action movie music layered over it – but as I said, this is just an opinion, maybe other people would think the music actually adds to the experience.\n\nAs for outright negatives as I said there are many. The graphics are poor, and completely inconsistent, the ship can look decent but the moon surface on descent looks more pixelated than Doom graphics (not an exaggeration), how glaring these inconsistencies are is impossible not to notice and for that alone kills a lot of the immersion.\n\nRead the full review and more here: https://www.opiumpulses.com/article/315/10-oculus-quest-new-release-reviews-p3",
