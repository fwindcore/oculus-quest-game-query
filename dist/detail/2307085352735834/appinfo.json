							"reviewDescription": "This game is really good, I mean really good. This is one of my favorite games on the quest as of right now, but I do have a few things that I would like to say to people who are going to buy this game.\n\n1) DON’T BUY IF YOU DON’T WANT COMPETITION \n\nThis game has no single player, so you will be only playing online. Sometimes you will get paired with a bot if the game can’t find another player, but this doesn’t happen all the time. The people on the game are really competitive, so if your not looking for a challenge I would not recommend. This is definitely not a game meant for the casual user. If I had to say something to devs, it would be to add a single player mode to the game, I personally have no complaints but I know many other people who can’t compete online would really appreciate a more laid back experience (Side note: when I say the community is competitive, I don’t mean toxic, many of the people I have meat are very nice and I almost always get a fist bump at the end of a round. If you don’t feel comfortable talking to people you can always turn off your mic)\n\n2) THIS GAME IS VERY MOVEMENT ORIENTED\n\nThis game WILL make you break a sweat, especially if you want to play well. There is a lot of moving around and arm flailing, so if your not in vr for exercise don’t try to play this. Me and my friend played for about 10 minutes and were already exhausted, I don’t know if that is just because we are unfit, but I have played many other movement games and have never been as exhausted as after playing this one.\n\nNow, I would like to go ahead and say that these are not complaints, I absolutely love the game, I just wanted to write this for people who don’t know what the game entails. I did not know these things getting into the game, but I still like it nonetheless. The only thing I would recommend to a dev is a single player mode for reasons I stated earlier. Overall, great game, it’s a steal for 10 bucks as long as you don’t mind challenge and exercise.",
