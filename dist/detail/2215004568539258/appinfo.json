							"reviewDescription": "If your a parent looking at reviews to see if this game is good for your child or children or even you, then this is the review you want to read. I will tell you what you do in this game, the good things about the game, and the bad. \n\nWHAT YOU DO IN ECHO VR: If you know how soccer works, then you will see that this game is really similar. It’s 2 teams and 1 disk. You have to throw the disk in the other teams goal. So if your on blue team, you have to get the disk in the Orange goal. If your on the orange team, you have to get the disk in the blue goal. You can also just hang out in the lobby to practice throwing, making new friends, customize you character, etc. \n\nGOOD THINGS ABOUT ECHO VR: \n1. You can make friends.\n\n2. You can mute others if you don’t want to talk to them or for you child/ children’s safety. \n\n3. It’s entertaining and can let time fly by.\n\n4. Its FREE \n\n5. This game has no hackers, and if echo vr does have hackers, then the moderators will look at the logs and ban them. \n\n6. If you are still lost and not knowing how to do certain things, then don’t worry because you can do the tutorial more than once. (I forgot to\nMention that you will automatically be given a tutorial before you actually start playing. It’s pretty helpful.)\n\n7. You can choose to be in a match with real people which is called a public match, or you can be in a AI match which is just playing with computers/ bots, or you can be in a Co-Op match which is just being on a team with real players and competing with bots. You can also choose the difficulty for AI matches. \n\nTHE BAD THINGS ABOUT ECHO VR:\n1. People DO use bad language \n\n2. People are sometimes inappropriate (which can be harmful to your kids)\n\n3. People bully children even for unnecessary reasons (can lead to depression, lack of eating, suicide, etc) \n\n4. In a match, people sometimes like to self goal. In other words, the team your on, the same team scores in your goal. So for example, your on blue team and some random person that’s on the same team as you scores in the blue goal on purpose. (If your new to this game and thing that’s it’s no big deal, then your SO WRONG. It’s a big a big deal to us players because what that does is that your stats gets ruined. Like me personally, I’m a lvl 51 and I had a streak of 97 games won in a row and some JERK self goals. That may not be a problem for you, but when they do that, all it’s doing is wasting your time\nFor your concern.)\n\nCONCLUSION: In the end, This game is really good for people who is over 12 or 13. Sometimes I hear VERY young kids play this game and who get bullied and even cry. I mean think about it, the game rating is Teen for a reason. If it wasn’t for all the bullying, language, sexual comments, racism, then I know for a fact that this game would be rated 10+. \n\nHOPEFULLY THIS WAS HELPFUL!!\n\n(Btw If you know me in game, let me know that you saw my review bc lots of people say thy have seen me in matches or in the lobby but I don’t even know half of the people who me😂)",
