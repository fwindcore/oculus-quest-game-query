And if you look carefully, there might even be some sandwich recipes for you to discover\nOculus Quest 2 improvements: We’ve added better graphics, refresh rate and assets for the new headset.\n\nAdditional bug fixes and updates have also been made to  the game.\n\nWe hope you enjoy the new updates.

This is possible in regular levels, endless mode and the tutorial. This can be either done in single player or when you are a host in multiplayer.\n- Added leaderboard support for the Endless Mode.\n- Added new game hints.\n- Added new spawn points for the Radish Dude.\n\nFixes:\n- Fixed bug that caused rewards in endless mode to not unlock properly. Save files affected by this should be automatically restored after installing the update.\n- Fixed bug that allowed the story voice over to play over itself.\n- Updated the world map to make it clearer how to use it. Also added tooltip on how to replay levels on the map.\n- Rebalanced a couple of early levels that were harder than intended.\n- Fixed bug that made it far too easy to knock off newly sliced ingredients off the table\n- Minor stability fixes.",

This game is phenomenal. But not only that, The Devs and the entire team? They are the true stars here, Right up there? Those 5 stars? Those are the team for this game. Cook-Out is such an excellent VR experience and a challenging feat as well, you’ll be replaying levels chasing 3 stars and it has excellent incentive too! \n\nYou are rewarded with a generous amount of skins and customizable cleavers and cutting boards and fridges and they are all lovingly modeled and all have charm and class. Finding a good team of chefs and then tackling on levels bestows a sense of having comrades and a genuine bond for a fleeting moment and those are the moments you take home with you but oh no, this review doesn’t stop there. \n\nOutside the game and in the Discord server? I have NEVER seen and interacted with such amazing people on the team of this game. Every one of the members on the team cares. Genuinely cares about this project, This game and most of all, it’s players. I always feel daunted and like I should keep to myself around people like developers, they have enough work to deal with, they don’t have time to check in on things. Not this team, oh not at all. You have an idea? Pitch it to them and you get a response back, something wrong in your game? Let em know and they are personally made aware of it and best of all they mingle with the players too and it’s just a breath of fresh air to see love given from players and returned back ten fold from them and letting you know that your voice is heard. Pick up this game and join the Discord too, Be apart of a community that cares about its game and you!",
