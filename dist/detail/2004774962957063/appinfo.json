But when I finally got into the game, I was impressed. First off, the visuals are unexpected. I didn’t think a game like this would look as good as it did on my headset, and I only have the quest 1. The visuals are clear and detailed, and it’s a pretty fun setting! Next, this game is insanely fun. If you’ve played Overcooked before, this is like that but better. You get to cook up orders for these fairy tale characters, each one having different twists to make it a little more challenging. It’s frantic and fast, but you’ll have a ton of fun. This is now one of my favorite games. Just wish there were more levels. Other than that, AMAZING game, 5 stars!",
