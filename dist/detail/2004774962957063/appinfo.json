And if you look carefully, there might even be some sandwich recipes for you to discover\nOculus Quest 2 improvements: We’ve added better graphics, refresh rate and assets for the new headset.\n\nAdditional bug fixes and updates have also been made to  the game.\n\nWe hope you enjoy the new updates.

This is possible in regular levels, endless mode and the tutorial. This can be either done in single player or when you are a host in multiplayer.\n- Added leaderboard support for the Endless Mode.\n- Added new game hints.\n- Added new spawn points for the Radish Dude.\n\nFixes:\n- Fixed bug that caused rewards in endless mode to not unlock properly. Save files affected by this should be automatically restored after installing the update.\n- Fixed bug that allowed the story voice over to play over itself.\n- Updated the world map to make it clearer how to use it. Also added tooltip on how to replay levels on the map.\n- Rebalanced a couple of early levels that were harder than intended.\n- Fixed bug that made it far too easy to knock off newly sliced ingredients off the table\n- Minor stability fixes.",

Especially buggy in endless mode.\n* In creative mode, the recipe book doesn’t explain what unique ingredients are.\n* The robot can be annoying in single player mode, it will add ingredients to sandwiches in the wrong order which requires you to rectify it which is time consuming and you can end up losing the round.\n\nSuggestions:\n* To fix the bug in endless mode (once fixed will give game 5 stars)\n* A feature to allow players to friend each other in the game. * Once a player leaves in the middle of the game, make the order that has their ingredients disappear. \n* To include what unique ingredients are in the recipe book. \n* I would love to see in the future a Cook-Out 2. Instead of sandwiches it would be serving pizzas. A range of bases: thin crust, deep pan, wholegrain, stuffed crust etc…different sauces: marinara sauce, creamy béchamel sauce, pesto, bbq etc cheeses and toppings. The different combos would be very challenging and fun.",
