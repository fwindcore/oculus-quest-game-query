When you came round, there were hundreds of the living dead all around you. All because of that damn T12 virus.\n\nTo survive and save the world from the virus, use both hands and your head: never stop shooting, pick up rounds, climb up pipes and ladders, jump onto bars and grab hold of ropes, search cupboards and throw everything you find at the zombies.\n\nYou’re free to choose whatever weapons and tactics you want. Prove your agility, imagination and accuracy.\n\nThe denizens of the Horizon station will punish you for one thing: hesitation...\n\n* FEATURES *\n\n●  Realistic bloody graphics in the spirit of zombie apocalypse films.\n●  Use two controllers actively: fire with both hands, fire as you hang on a rope, reload your shotgun with your second hand, grab onto pipes and explore hard-to-reach areas of the station.",

Can't wait for last chapter but I am not there yet. Any reviews who take a star off because game is not finished makes no sense. They say the final chapter is coming so you know that when you buy it. This developer seems to care about it's game with constant updates and listen to player feedback. Let's get the 5 stars percentage up. Most games release on here and never a update. This is my go to game. And I live the achievements. Just a added touch that most developers don't even bother with. Would like maybe some paid dlc so we can support developers more. Just seems like they love there game and care about the community. Keep up the great work.",
