							"reviewDescription": "This game is in 1 word, excellent. \nAs someone that works in VR roomscale software development, I was skeptical that the Quest 1 and Quest 2 would have decent enough processing power to pull off a standalone game which can be enjoyed for hours on end... I was wrong.\n\nDeath Horizon is quite simply amazing, I set up two roomscale zones in one room so family members could play co-op in the same game. We spent hours immersed in this title, running around shooting zombies with the decent weapon selection offered by the game.\n\nGraphically it is what would be expected of a game running on a standalone headset; not photorealistic, but with enough detail packed in to the environments to fully immerse you in the game. The art department have done a great job with this one. Textures are clear, objects and characters are not too low poly and the guns look great. The lighting is on-point really setting the mood. One great moment was entering the reactor chamber and seeing its immense scale!\n\nMy only caveats and areas of improvement for co-op:\n\n- There were a few instances where myself or the other person playing would clip through walls or floors in the map and not be able to get back in\n\n- Sometimes ammo is displayed on the HUD but none of the guns would have any ammo when trying to shoot\n\n- It would be great if the VOIP capabilites could be toggled in the settings menu, as we were experiencing audio latency being in the same room, and could already hear each other.\n\n- We really wanted to return to our checkpoint after closing the game for the day, it would be good to have a co-op saving capability.\n\n- Being able to hold more than 1 larger gun in our holsters would be an awesome improvement.\n\n- Having the ability to throw the other player ammo from our own belts if they need it would help a lot.\n\n- If a DLC came along, some outdoor environments would be a nice addition\n\nI would 100% recommend this game to anyone with a Quest 1 and Quest 2 - it runs well on both with some obvious resolution and character improvements on the 2. \n\nHopefully more environments are being worked on because I would definitely buy a DLC!",
