Superbright respects their audience enough to listen, engage in dialogue, and update their wonderful product to reflect the feedback, desires, and collective wisdom of us, the humble players.\n\nThis is a 21st century developer, using modern communication methods to engage with their base and improve their product. \nConstantly. \nConsistently. \nThe version of In Death which I'm about to play today is heads and shoulders above the day-1 version, and that's a fantastic thing. Even more fantastic, is the fact that 90% of these improvements were called out by us, the players. Superbright is forging the path of developing a RELATIONSHIP with us, based on 2-way communication, with everyone involved laser focused on just shaping a really really good game. Ultimately, it's all about fun, right? Buying In Death on day-1, leaving a review and having Superbright leave a thoughtful reply, playing In Death again a few days later and seeing improvements implemented that I contributed towards.....that's all been a really fun, and rewarding, experience.\n\nGoing forward, I will be buying any Quest product produced by Superbright sight unseen, because I have confidence that they have my best interests at heart, and they have the humility to exist in a state of constant learning, change, and improvement. This is how you make a customer for life. Well done Superbright.\n\nTL;DR: Agile. Nimble. Responsive. Respectful of our time & passion. They listen, and they improve. Bravo Superbright. Five Stars.",
