							"body_text": "Hey everyone!\n\nSeason 3 is in full swing and now it’s time for some extra competition! We present to you In Death: Unchained - 15 Minutes of Fame Tournament.\n\nFight for the next generation full-body haptic suits from bHaptics and many other prizes!\n\nWhat’s the tournament about?\n\nIt's about the highest score! Each day of the tournament will be dedicated to one map:\n- 1st and 4th day: Purgatory\n- 2nd and 5th day: Paradise Lost\n- 3rd and 6th day: The Abyss\n\nTry to get as many points as possible in one run. Each run lasts 15 minutes and you can try as many times as you want. Your personal highest score from each map will be saved and the sum of all 3 top scores will be displayed on a Total Leaderboard. There will be separate leaderboards for bow and crossbow players.\n\nThere are also four teams competing for the highest score. Each team is led by a fantastic Content Creator you can watch and follow on YouTube. You can decide which team to support before each run - simply stand on one of the colored beacons to support one of the teams or choose the gray beacon in the middle if you want to play without supporting any team. You can support multiple teams over the course of the tournament should you wish.\n\nVR Content Creators, you can support by joining their team:\n- Beardo Benjo http://youtube.com/BeardoBenjo\n- Matteo311 http://youtube.com/Gamingwithmatteo311\n- Soul Fox Gaming http://youtube.com/SoulFoxGaming\n- SteveKnows http://youtube.com/SteveKnows\n\nHow to enter the tournament?\n\nGo through the new portal in Sanctuary. Choose if you want to support one of the teams or not. Playing every single day of the Tournament gives you (and your team if you choose one) the best chance of winning!\n\nWhat are the rewards?\n\nEvery participant gets:\n- set of special weapon skins, which will stay in the game forever\n- legend points\n\nBow and crossbow podium winners get:\n- 1st place winners will receive Oculus Quest 2 Elite Strap with battery and case or equivalent\n- 2nd place will receive Oculus Quest 2 Elite Strap or equivalent\n- 3rd place winners will receive: Oculus Quest 2 Elite Strap or equivalent\n\nThe teams will compete against each other for the highest score (sum of total scores of the players who supported the team). The rewards will be distributed by Content Creators depending on their place in the competition. To sign up for the reward raffle, follow the instructions available on your team's Content Creator YouTube channel!\nDepending on the place taken by his team, the Content Creator receives a prize pool to be raffled among the players who signed up for the raffle:\n\n- 1st place: bHaptics TactSuit X40 + 5 codes for any game in Oculus Store\n- 2nd place: bHaptics TactSuit X40 + 4 codes for any game in the Oculus Store\n- 3rd place: bHaptics TactSuit X16 + 3 codes for any game in the Oculus Store\n- 4th place: bHaptics TactSuit X16 + 2 codes for any game in the Oculus Store\n\nEveryone who supported a Content Creator can sign up to an award raffle.\n\nWhat else is important?\n\n- You play with your own achievement progress\n- Entrance to the Pits does not appear in the Tournament mode\n- If you're fast enough to defeat Anakim, Gabriel, or Asmodeus before the time is up, you'll start the same map over on a higher cycle\n- After 15 minutes are up you’ll get teleported back to Sanctuary\n- You can check the remaining time by looking at your hand (palm up)\n- If you die during the run your score still saves to the Leaderboard\n- Leaderboards will be updated every 15 minutes\n\nThe tournament will be on until 8 AM PDT/5 PM CEST May 20th.\n\nWe can’t wait to have our minds blown by the scores you can achieve in just 15 minutes. So grab your bows and crossbows and show us what you can do!\n\nGood luck!\nSuperbright",

Now is a good moment to ensure your experience, rewards, and fame!\n\nStay tuned!",
