							"reviewDescription": "In the VR game space, the point and shoot game is an oversaturated genre. I've bought and played, in ascending order of preference; Gun Club, Drop Dead, Space Pirate, Robo Recall, Pistol Whip and In Death. Whether the targets are soldiers, aliens, robots, monsters, the mechanics remain the same. Waves of enemies, shoot them before they shoot/reach you. Out of ammo? Reload, keep shooting!\n\nWhen you finally fall, there's one thing to do, try again. Can you beat your score? Maybe you've unlocked some new weapons, some attachments, but the next game will, in many cases, play out the same as the first, the same targets, popping up in the same places. How compelling you find this over time will depend on how appealing you find the theme, and if the game has a USP...\n\nIn Death is a stand out in this landscape for a number of reasons. With each run the fundamentals remain the same, you're gonna be firing arrows at Monks, Knights, Ghouls and a variety of enemies which I won't spoil here. \n\nHowever, immediately with each run the game will offer a new layout to the environment, and the game's locomotion mechanics will allow you to move through that environment with a freedom rarely offered by the genre. You can move through the environs using the analogue stick, using your magic teleportation arrows, sidestep by tossing a teleport crystal, or you can move yourself physically to avoid incoming attacks. Your teleportation power will offer up options that are not immediately intuitive, and if you experiment you'll experience moments of surprise and joy.\n\nEach inevitable death will return you to the start of the game and you're presented with you score and progress toward a number of unlocks which are going to make your next run simultaeneously easier and more challenging. \n\nThe Bow feels good. New types of arrow, and new enemies keep strategies changing and keep things fresh. My only criticism is that the full extent of the bowstring can lead to tracking issues.",
