							"reviewDescription": "Let me start by saying just how incredible this game is. I picked it up on a whim and I did not regret it. The combat is fun, thought out, and each close up encounter is like a little puzzle. Where is their weapon gonna attack from next? The UI is clean, understandable, and stylized. There really isn’t anything the game is missing, other than some more classes which are probably on the way. My first complaint is pretty simple. Some of the cosmetic items that the CPU’s are able to use don’t seem to be available for players to use themselves, which is a shame, because they look awesome. Another problem is the prices of the cosmetics. Though you don’t have to pay actual money for any of them except for the one $0.99 one, they are ridiculously expensive. 1,000,000g for the final color scheme, 300,000 for the second to last one, and 100,000 for the third to last one, not to mention the fact that there are multiple sections in the cosmetics menu that each have one that costs 1,000,000g. To put that much time into a game just for a cosmetic is absurd. You get about 1,200g per battle on the hardest difficulty, and they each take about 5 minutes to complete, so if you used nothing but duels (the fastest way to make money in the game) you would be playing the game for over 7,500 hours. Insanity. Fortunately, these do nothing to the actual gameplay, other than the armors, which add a bit of extra Defense when you wear certain ones. The problem is that half of the game is about looking cool while you fight, and holy wow do these skins look cool. That’s problem number one. Problem two (and the only other problem with the game) is the balancing of each class. Any class that uses one weapon that you can hold with two hands (Monk, Reaper, Knight, Samurai, Berserker) completely overshadows all the other classes (except Crusader, which I’ll get to) such as the ninja and the duelist to the point where playing through the campaign with them is nearly impossible. The Crusader on the other hand, is an exception to this rule, being far and away the most overpowered class in this game. Incredibly easy to use, get headshots, deal massive damage, and the projectile is absolutely insane. Even blocking is super easy with this class thanks to the gigantic shield that comes with the class. I’m not saying to nerf anyone. Nerfing doesn’t make a class more fair, it just makes it less fun to play. I’m saying to buff everyone to the level of crusader. By making everyone overpowered, all the classes are on equal footing, and are all super fun to play. That’s it for number 2. I just have a few questions. When playing through the campaign mode, I’ve noticed that some of the lackeys in the early rounds of exhibition matches seem to use classes that are unavailable to players, such as a knight with the projectile of the ninja class, or these guys with cannon arms that can shoot projectiles with tons of damage, and can infinitely block attacks with their cannon arm without losing durability, but can engage in up-close combat on their own. Heck, I even ran into a Ninja class with these awesome cosmetic knives, but they were able to shoot the projectile of the Knight, and had the weapon durability system of the samurai, and I just really wanted to play at that class, not because it was overpowered (it was actually pretty easy) but because it looked fun. I also think that there needs to be a better implementation of rumble in the controller. Especially for the hammer. I want to feel the hammer bashing into the ground for the projectile attack. I want to feel the drawstring of the bow getting tighter and the rumble suddenly releasing when you let the arrow fly. I want to feel my shield blocking each attack. I want to feel the sword become uneven when blocking with the knight. It really needs some revisions. Overall, this is a fantastic game, but with a few flaws holding it back from being perfect. Allowing some of the CPU specific items and classes to be used by players, lowering the cost of the cosmetics, and rebalancing the game would make this the must have game of any VR system. If you actually read all this, then thanks for reading my long ramblings. That’s all for this review.",
