Test your skills in multiplayer battles, or fight to the top of the league in the huge single-player campaign!\n\nSKILLFUL SWORDPLAY\nIronlights features dynamic back-and-forth swordplay thanks to a unique melee combat system. All weapons shatter on impact, and you have to swing them back behind you to “reload” them. You can’t just wiggle your sword at your opponent. Instead, you’ll need to parry their attacks and cleverly slip past their defenses in a tense slow-motion fight scene!\n\nCHOOSE YOUR WEAPON\nFrom huge greatswords to quick rapiers, each weapon has its own unique weight and physics. Pick your favorite fighting style, whether you’re a Knight or a Ninja.\n\nMULTIPLAYER\nFight online and climb the ranks to claim the title of Champion!",

							"reviewDescription": "My name is Sir Shield and I am known in game as one of the best monks and the creator of the community servers as well as the community TikTok (Too see gameplay see our tiktok @ironlightsvr)\n\nI have yet to leave a review and I feel it is necessary for me to clear the air with some of these bad reviews the game has recieved by fully breaking down the problems the game actually has and then explaining the reasons why most of these one star reviews are a joke.\n\nThe game was developed by TWO people, so bare this in mind as you critique this game. \n\nPros:\n\n* Regular balance updates with data from the community and behind the scenes analytics collected after each match.\n* Over 10 excellently balanced classes to choose from.\n* Over 20 custom, for fun weapons to choose from in custom matches.\n* Ability to have private matches with your friends.\n* Free spectator client for easy twitch streaming.\n* Only one $0.99 USD microtransaction. Everything else is free.\n* Customizable armour and armour colors.\n* Campaign mode and Online 1 v 1 PVP mode\n* Ability to create your own personal NPC down to every move they make and share your creations with the community. \n* Weekly tournaments.\n* Tierd ranking system.\n* A very active developer who rewards players with special in game armour and their bot added to the campaign mode if they win a Major Tournament. \n* In game gif maker with first person, 3rd person and handheld cameras with HD uploads sent to your email for free.\n* Super positive and supportive community \n\nCons:\n\n* The game is absolutely skill based like no other game I have seen. This can be a problem because too many of you reading this like to play games on the easiest difficulty and when you lose you come here and cry \"this game is unbalanced\" or \"spam wins games\" as if you're a savage at your class and the enemy sucks but won. We have am entire official discord for training you, so learn to block and stop spreading lies.\n\n* Slow Motion is absolutely required for a game where your weapon breaks each time the oponent hits or blocks your weapon. Don't believe me? Custom matches have over a dozen options to adjust your gameplay, so turn slomo off and see how much you hate not having slomo. Also as you rise the ranks, you'll see that players move so fast you don't even realize it's slomo and if anything it isnt slow enough.\n\n* Ranged spam. Ranged is available for every class and they are all EASILY blockable or avoidable. Those of you who complain of this need to join the discord and learn the game. For example. Berserker ranged sends out about a dozen HEAT SEEKING missiles, meaning, literally just sidestep and all of them miss you. Only like 3 people in game that are top players are able to kill you with ranged only, because ranged isn't a viable way to damage your oponent.\n\n* Repetitive. If you notice all cons above are cons from 1 star reviews... because all the one star reviewers have no idea how to play the game or how to fight and it shows. But this is an actual con. The campaign mode can get repetitive and the pvp can leave you disheartened when on a streak. But name another VR game that doesn't do that. Lol join the Training Halls discord and see the #inspiration channel. NEVER. GIVE. UP. KING/QUEEN.\n\nI hope this helped you come to the decision to buy the game, because that's the decision you will not regret!\n\nSir Shield out",
