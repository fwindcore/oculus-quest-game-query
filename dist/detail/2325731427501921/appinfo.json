As an elven assassin, you will make spectacular shots like long distance headshots.\n\nPIECE OF CAKE THEN?\nNot really. The Orcs are running fast, they break into houses to hide from your arrows, and when they got furious their massive axe is thrown to splash your head into pieces. \n\nASSASSIN UNITED.\nUp to four assassins may unite to defend the town.

							"body_text": "Hello archers!\nWe've released a new update, and with it a lot of changes.\n\nTo start with, we have improved the graphics on the Oculus Quest 2. Each map has received a visual upgrade and looks much better. Now owners of this headset will be able to enjoy better visuals! \nHere is a few examples:\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to updating the graphics for Quest 2, we've added a few new features for everyone to enjoy.\n\nSnap turn\nThe first feature is \"Snap turn\", which is the ability to rotate on the platform using the controller stick. You can enable this feature in the settings, as it is disabled by default.\n\nMute players\nAnother feature is the ability to mute other players in the game. You can do this by clicking the microphone on the scoreboard. But remember, just because you can't hear him, it doesn't mean that he can't hear you ;).\n\nRoaring dragon\nAnother change is the roaring dragon. When a dragon wave comes, the dragon will make a powerful roar to let you know that he is coming. Now you will be better prepared for his arrival.\n\nDiscord Server\nThe last change is the icon of our Discord server in the settings. If you want to join the server and chat with others, this is the best way to do it.\n\nA note to the previous update:\nRecently you have been asking a lot about the \"Password cooldown feature\" because we haven't fully explained what it is. \"Password cooldown\" is a new feature to prevent unwanted players from joining the game. Previously, you could guess the password to a private lobby over and over until you succeeded. Now with each incorrectly entered password, the user will have to wait a few seconds to enter the password again. This should discourage some players from breaking into private games.\n\nWe hope you enjoy the update. Let us know what you think. \nYou can do this on our new, official Facebook group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/elvenassassin",

							"body_text": "Hello, Elven Assassins!\nThe time has come!\nUpdate 1.4 has been officially released. From today, you can play on two new maps and enjoy the new content we have prepared.\n\nThe Last Stronghold\nThe first map is called The Last Stronghold. It is a large map with lots of platforms located on the battlefield in front of the castle. In The Last Stronghold, you can expect a lot of new features that were not available in the game before.\n\n\n\nThe Horn\nThe first feature is a horn which you can blow (or shout ;) ) to cause a rain of burning projectiles fired from catapults located in the castle. It works perfectly against groups of opponents.\n\n\n\nThe Ballista\nThe second one is the ballista. It stands on one of the platforms and waits for someone to use it. It doesn't do too well against small units, but it is very useful against bigger enemies.\n\n\n\nGiant Troll\nSpeaking of the bigger enemies, you will be able to meet a giant troll. Watch out for him, because he will greet you by throwing a huge rock.\n\n\n\nWinter Mountains\nThe second map is called Winter Mountains and is created in a more classic style. Here we focused on beautiful scenery and classic Elven Assassin gameplay.\n\n\n\nClassic gameplay\nWe wanted to create an environment that would impress with its atmosphere, not with additional mechanics. We're sure that thanks to this, each of you will find something for yourself.\n\n\n\nLet us know what you think about the changes we made.\nHave fun!",

I gone 45 mins to an hour into waves to have it ruined by a child coming Into the room and jumping podium to podium getting in players faces getting both killed your yourself... This is a real kill joy when you can't remove bad players. ruins your game experience, and people will just unfortunately stop playing.. You need to add a boot option for hosts who hosts games to remove distruptive players before they ruin your hard work. Mind you some kids are great players. \n\nI will give full 5 stars when boot option/ player removal is available.",
