							"body_text": "Hello archers!\nWe've released a new update, and with it a lot of changes.\n\nTo start with, we have improved the graphics on the Oculus Quest 2. Each map has received a visual upgrade and looks much better. Now owners of this headset will be able to enjoy better visuals! \nHere is a few examples:\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to updating the graphics for Quest 2, we've added a few new features for everyone to enjoy.\n\nSnap turn\nThe first feature is \"Snap turn\", which is the ability to rotate on the platform using the controller stick. You can enable this feature in the settings, as it is disabled by default.\n\nMute players\nAnother feature is the ability to mute other players in the game. You can do this by clicking the microphone on the scoreboard. But remember, just because you can't hear him, it doesn't mean that he can't hear you ;).\n\nRoaring dragon\nAnother change is the roaring dragon. When a dragon wave comes, the dragon will make a powerful roar to let you know that he is coming. Now you will be better prepared for his arrival.\n\nDiscord Server\nThe last change is the icon of our Discord server in the settings. If you want to join the server and chat with others, this is the best way to do it.\n\nA note to the previous update:\nRecently you have been asking a lot about the \"Password cooldown feature\" because we haven't fully explained what it is. \"Password cooldown\" is a new feature to prevent unwanted players from joining the game. Previously, you could guess the password to a private lobby over and over until you succeeded. Now with each incorrectly entered password, the user will have to wait a few seconds to enter the password again. This should discourage some players from breaking into private games.\n\nWe hope you enjoy the update. Let us know what you think. \nYou can do this on our new, official Facebook group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/elvenassassin",

							"body_text": "Hello, Elven Assassins!\nThe time has come!\nUpdate 1.4 has been officially released. From today, you can play on two new maps and enjoy the new content we have prepared.\n\nThe Last Stronghold\nThe first map is called The Last Stronghold. It is a large map with lots of platforms located on the battlefield in front of the castle. In The Last Stronghold, you can expect a lot of new features that were not available in the game before.\n\n\n\nThe Horn\nThe first feature is a horn which you can blow (or shout ;) ) to cause a rain of burning projectiles fired from catapults located in the castle. It works perfectly against groups of opponents.\n\n\n\nThe Ballista\nThe second one is the ballista. It stands on one of the platforms and waits for someone to use it. It doesn't do too well against small units, but it is very useful against bigger enemies.\n\n\n\nGiant Troll\nSpeaking of the bigger enemies, you will be able to meet a giant troll. Watch out for him, because he will greet you by throwing a huge rock.\n\n\n\nWinter Mountains\nThe second map is called Winter Mountains and is created in a more classic style. Here we focused on beautiful scenery and classic Elven Assassin gameplay.\n\n\n\nClassic gameplay\nWe wanted to create an environment that would impress with its atmosphere, not with additional mechanics. We're sure that thanks to this, each of you will find something for yourself.\n\n\n\nLet us know what you think about the changes we made.\nHave fun!",

							"reviewDescription": "One of the best co-op games I own and one of the first I purchased because of how fun it is to play with other people. \n\nAll you do is shoot waves of enemies with a bow while standing in a spot defending a village/town/castle depending on a map you choose. Since every map has 4+ defense points you can teleport around the map depending of where the enemy forces come from. With the last update there are five maps to choose from. \n\nEvery wave is harder than the one before and enemy types go from orcs to flying dragons and trolls. If an enemy unit goes through you lose HP points of the town. If you lose all 100% the game is over.\n\nAs you play more and more you gain levels and also earn spell points (one every level). There are spells in form of special arrows which can really help you in tougher situations. Fire arrows, icy slowing arrows, explosive shots, shields, etc.\n\nYou also gain gold which can be used to buy some gear which is only cosmetic so it doesn’t force you to.\n\nThe single player gameplay is not that great as you don’t survive that long but it’s the multiplayer aspect that makes this game fun. I play this with my friends but you can also find some open games on a server. The co-op mode allows 4 people to play together which is really fun as the waves get harder and harder. There is also a map for PvP game where you shoot each other for points.\n\nDevelopers are doing a great job with keeping this game fresh and latest update brought us two huge maps with many defending positions as well as some new features like ballista. The graphics are not as great as on PC but since it runs on Oculus it’s still very nice to look at. Voice chat works fine and allows you to either use push-to-talk or voice activated “always speak” option.\n\nThere are still few things that bug me a little. It would be nice if we had an option to start the game from the wave we already defeated without the need of starting a game from wave 1 every time. What I also don’t get is why is there such a long wait between waves in later stages of the game.\n\nSummed up it’s a really fun bow shooting game if you’re looking for some co-op fun. It might feel a bit lonely and disappointing when playing solo but it does the job. I definitely recommend!",
