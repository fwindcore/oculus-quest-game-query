If you thought: \"Of course, slaying them with my friends online in co-op mode!\", then this is the matter of destiny.\n\nBECOME AN ELVEN ASSASSIN.\nTake a bow and kill hundreds of enemies that want to get into the elven town and destroy it. As an elven assassin, you will make spectacular shots like long distance headshots.\n\nPIECE OF CAKE THEN?\nNot really. The Orcs are running fast, they break into houses to hide from your arrows, and when they got furious their massive axe is thrown to splash your head into pieces. \n\nASSASSIN UNITED.\nUp to four assassins may unite to defend the town. Communicate using voice chat, but watch your language. \n\nDisclaimer: \nAny similarity to any other fantasy movie, game or book is purely coincidental.",

From today, you can play on two new maps and enjoy the new content we have prepared.\n\nThe Last Stronghold\nThe first map is called The Last Stronghold. It is a large map with lots of platforms located on the battlefield in front of the castle. In The Last Stronghold, you can expect a lot of new features that were not available in the game before.\n\n\n\nThe Horn\nThe first feature is a horn which you can blow (or shout ;) ) to cause a rain of burning projectiles fired from catapults located in the castle. It works perfectly against groups of opponents.\n\n\n\nThe Ballista\nThe second one is the ballista. It stands on one of the platforms and waits for someone to use it. It doesn't do too well against small units, but it is very useful against bigger enemies.\n\n\n\nGiant Troll\nSpeaking of the bigger enemies, you will be able to meet a giant troll. Watch out for him, because he will greet you by throwing a huge rock.\n\n\n\nWinter Mountains\nThe second map is called Winter Mountains and is created in a more classic style. Here we focused on beautiful scenery and classic Elven Assassin gameplay.\n\n\n\nClassic gameplay\nWe wanted to create an environment that would impress with its atmosphere, not with additional mechanics. We're sure that thanks to this, each of you will find something for yourself.\n\n\n\nLet us know what you think about the changes we made.\nHave fun!",

Love it and enjoy it very much... \n\nhowever since Christmas it's beginning to be ruined by disruptive children players joining your hosted games and intentionally disrupting your game. I gone 45 mins to an hour into waves to have it ruined by a child coming Into the room and jumping podium to podium getting in players faces getting both killed your yourself... This is a real kill joy when you can't remove bad players. ruins your game experience, and people will just unfortunately stop playing.. You need to add a boot option for hosts who hosts games to remove distruptive players before they ruin your hard work. Mind you some kids are great players. \n\nI will give full 5 stars when boot option/ player removal is available.",
