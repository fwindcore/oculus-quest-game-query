Please read the following:\n\nControls:\n\n- Smooth Turning Added - We have added a smooth turning mode for those who prefer this style. This is available via the comfort section of the settings menu.\n\nGameplay:\n\n- Grenade Launcher - The grenade launcher projectiles now explode on contact with enemies rather than bouncing.\n\n- Chapter 9 Boss Storm Bolters - Two of the Storm Bolters had inconsistent behaviours, this has been rectified to make this encounter more enjoyable.\n\n- Power Sword - The Power Sword itself now glows with dangerous power\n\n- Chapter 10 Enemies - The visuals of the enemies in Chapter 10 have been improved along with tweaks to their AI to increase their intelligence.\n\n- Chapter 7 Boss - logic, visual effect and animation improvements to this boss encounter to make it more lethal and challenging.\n\n- Chapter 2 Window - a shiny new window looking out to Belis Retani beyond.\n\n- Chapter 6 Puzzle Refinement - improvements to the puzzles in Chapter 6 that help to signpost gameplay and readability.\n\n- Score Tracking and Balancing - Inconsistencies between score tracking in campaign mode and level replay have been removed. As a consequence of this, we need to reset leaderboards to ensure a level playing field for those chasing top scores, we apologise for the inconvenience of this.\n\nBug Fixes:\n\n- Environment Streaming Tweaks - to remove some environment pop in occurring.\n\n- General Stability Improvements - a series of bug fixes and improvements to increase overall game stability. This includes visual fixes, nav mesh fixes for stuck enemies and minor bugs found by the community.\n\nWe will continue to refine and update the experience of Battle Sister based on community feedback and reports in future updates. We would like to say a huge thank you to everyone who has shared their feedback with us so far.\n\nHappy Holidays from the Pixel Toys team!",

Kept me interested and wasn’t looking for anything heavy. Bigger assortment of guns would be nice.\nShame there is no way to avoid being shot at. That needs to be improved.\nOverall a good game and some nostalgia there from real like warhammer. Think it’s worth a purchase. For the price I think it’s over but I managed a discount so made more sense when the price was reduced",
