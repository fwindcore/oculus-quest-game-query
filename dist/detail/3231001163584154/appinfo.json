							"body_text": "A brand new update to Battle Sister is here! We’re excited to announce that this year Battle Sister will be featured inside the Games Workshop Skulls Festival (Formally Skull for the Skull Throne) to celebrate the team here at Pixel Toys have prepared a brand new horde map: Heart of Dread and released Warhammer 40,000: Battle Sister on Rift.\n\nNew Horde Map\n\nHeart of Dread takes place inside the deepest, darkest depths of a Chaos space vessel. Battle your way through wave after wave of heretic horde and claim their skulls to upgrade your arsenal of weaponry. This map gives access from all sides of the centre ring, both on ground level, and on the second floor allowing enemies easy access to swarm into the bastion. This map definitely requires some quick thinking and a little bit of good old fashioned teamwork in co-op mode.\n\nHeart of Dread map is our fourth addition to the Last Bastion and available to play right now in both solo and co-op mode!\n\n\n\nNew Rift Version\n\nWe’re also delighted to announce that the Rift version of Battle Sister is now available to play with crossplay and cross-buy enabled. For the uninitiated, this means those who purchase the game on Quest will have access to the Rift version for free and vice versa whilst also being able to play with heroes across both devices.\n\nOur Rift version utilises the power of PC VR to beautifully and masterfully increase texture resolution across all environments, weapons and characters - Immerse yourself deeper into the universe of Warhammer 40,000 with the power of Rift.\n\n\n\nWhat’s next?\n\nWe’re keen to hear from the community about where our next update focus should be pointed towards.

Most of the time by melee will not hit or cause damage. \n             Story is very confusing...I’d say this is more opinion based but I could not get a solid understanding of the story.\n             Graphics..don’t get me wrong, this game is beautiful looking however some things aren’t.\n\nI have no hate towards this game.\n\nThis is a understanding of what I did and didn’t like.",
