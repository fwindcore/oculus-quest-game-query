Directed by Sadah Espii Proctor, Girl Icon is part of the Oculus VR for Good Creators Lab program in partnership with Malala Fund and Milaan Foundation.\n\nAround the world, more than 130 million girls are out of school. Step into the life of Rani, a girl from India who is part of a growing movement of girls inspired by Malala Yousafzai to change their path and become educated community leaders.\n\n“I want girls to look at me and think they can achieve anything they want,\" says 17-year-old Rani, from Varanasi, India. Rani's community and the Hindu caste system limits her family to washing clothes and linen for a living. But Rani is determined to finish school and train to become an army officer. In Girl Icon, Rani gives us an intimate glimpse of her life, hopes, challenges and dreams — and how she's helping other girls in her community.",

The Compton Cowboys (@comptoncowboys) are reframing some of the ways of the old West , using horseback riding to connect with the community. Their motto “the streets raised us, the horses saved us” reflects how they’ve provided an enriching alternative to the danger of the streets. Randy Savvy takes us through the history of the Compton Cowboys and shares how they galvanized the equestrian community and the entire city for a Peace Ride.",
