The ‘Darwin Code’ mandates conformity to species-specific by-laws where individual expression is prohibited and heavily enforced by militarized droids who punish any that challenge the code.  But a subversive group resists and lights a flame for others to follow.  This group is known only as the ‘Rebels’.",

Yonatan graduated from the Character Animation Program at CalArts and worked at the Development department of Disney TV.\n\n‘Lifetime Achievement’ is Parade’s first VR experience, a story that follows world-class French designer, Albert, on a journey to create a masterpiece for his mother. Join him on his adventure to encounter an African albino crocodile, develop new lifeforms in a lab, and capture light rays from a spatial solar eclipse. His elaborate expedition taught him the valuable lesson that presence is the best present.",

It’s 2021 and right on my home screen near the top\nOTV is like “watch this video from 2016”.  As of this writing they’re hyping some Oscar short film for like a month.  I finally check it out .... its a 2D film!\n\nReally odd that Facebook of all companies couldn’t manage this aspect better.",
