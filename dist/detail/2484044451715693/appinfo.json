Well now you can glide continuously through as many as you like with Playlists!\n\n\nLook under the Options menu for the new 'Playlists' button\n\n\nUnder the Options menu, you'll now find a button for Playlists, which turns on this new mode. When in Playlists mode, you can either choose, edit, or create your own playlist and then launch to start your Trips! And yes, you use the launch button to start your Trips, as always!\n\n\nPlay the Built-in Playlists, or create your own!\n\n\nWe've created some Built-in Playlists for you to play - which you can hide with the click of the 'Built-in Playlists' button if you like - but this mode is also for you to create as many Playlists as you want! If you want to create a new one, make sure you have Playlists Mode turned on (under Options) and just click the [ create new ] button under the Playlists Menu. Then choose as many Trips as you want from the main menu to fill out your playlist! And yes, this works with custom Trips as well!\n\nWhen you click on each Trip in the Main Menu you, they will be automatically added to your new playlist.\n\n\nEditing Playlists\nOnce you create your new playlist, or choose one of ours to edit, there are few other things you can do..\n\nSwitch each Trip length from Full Trip to Quick Trip right in the playlist using the Trip Type button next to each Trip.\nRemove Trips from the playlist.\nRename the playlist.\nSave your playlist! *Note: If you don't save, but play through the playlist, the game will automatically save a [ previously played ] list for you - but just make sure to Save it if you'd like to keep it and play again!\n\n\nPlaying through Playlists\nWant to skip to the next song? Now when Pause the game while Playlists mode is on, you'll see a new button to skip to the next song in the list. Of course you can also Restart the song, Resume where you left off, or Exit to the Hub World, like normal. This option is available if you Fail during a Trip as well!\n\n\n\nAnd as long as you DON'T have 'No Fail' turned on, all of your scores in Playlists Mode will count toward the global leaderboards, just like single Trips!\n\nFinally, if you'd like to return to just playing one Trip at a time, you can always just toggle off Playlists again under Options.\n\n\nHave fun with your new playlists!\nWe'll get back to work now on more fun stuff to show you soon! Til then, keep dancing.\n\n< 3 Kinemotik",

							"created_time": 1612958009,
							"body_text": "CARDIO LEVELS now available on all 18 songs\n\nIntroducing our new Cardio Levels! Based on the amazing feedback from our beta tester community, we're happy to announce that our experimental Cardio levels were such a hit, that we've now created one for every song in the game! Thank you to all of our fitness-focused Trippers for giving us such great feedback to help make this possible.\n\nSo, WHAT IS A CARDIO LEVEL?? These levels are a bit different than the others... They focus on giving you a Cardio(vascular) workout -- They include BIG, full-range, repetitious movements to get your heart pumping! So now you can workout to a star-studded tracklist including artists such as Lady Gaga, Skrillex, Zedd, and more! And of course, you can follow our lead on these new choreographies and copy these moves into your own songs with our in-VR editor to create your own workouts.\n\nBut first, a few words of CAUTION for these new levels...\n- Make sure you warm up first, as these levels require full-range full body movement. Remember to squat and lean with your knees, and move your feet if you need to reach!\n- These moves require a bigger playspace than our other levels, so check your surroundings and proceed with caution.\n- These levels are not recommended for Beginners - They are designed to be around a Regular level difficulty.\n\nAlso... some Cardio levels are inherently more strenuous than others. \nHere's a tip: Dance Monkey and Golden Pineapple are easier Cardio levels, and Jurassic Snack Pack and Red are... let's just say you'll need endurance.\n\nSo... Got some dusty fitness-related New Year resolutions on the shelf? It's time to smash through them.\n\nHave fun, stay hydrated, and keep dancing,\n♥️ Kinemotik",
