							"reviewDescription": "This is a really hard title for us to review and is difficult for us to talk about without a little sadness. Wands is one of the first truly cross-platform, online PVP virtual reality games – and by cross-platform we mean REALLLLY cross-platform, players can match up against anyone on a silly amount of headsets, Daydream, GearVR, Oculus Go, Oculus Quest, Oculus Rift, PSVR, SteamVR, Viveport, Mirage Solo and I imagine more that we’ve missed out, can all play against one another. So that should mean its impossible for the servers to be empty, right?\n\n\nUnfortunately, you’re wrong. We’ve tried playing Wands online on our Quest a few times over the past year and never found any strangers to match up with. It’s possible that we’re searching at bad times in the day but with all those headsets there should be hundreds of players. Looking at the statistics on Steam, it seems like the record number of Steam players online at once was seven, yes seven, and that was three years ago.\n\n\nBut we’re reviewing the game, not its audience and that is where we have nothing but good stuff to say. The general concept is that you play as wizards with various wand and spell upgrades to unlock as you rank up. You battle one-on-one against either AI or human players, teleporting around the map to dodge incoming attacks or to flank your enemy. The gameplay is fast-paced and exhilarating, particularly against a hard AI or a friend you’ve planned to jump online and play with. The game released in 2016 and the devs are still pushing out large updates as recently as a month ago, that’s a level of dedication that more developers could do with. For its intense, tactical online matches and cross-play support that rivals most if not all other online titles, Wands wields a fair 4/5.\n\nRead the full review and more here: https://www.opiumpulses.com/article/407/10-more-oculus-quest-game-reviews-p1",

We really appreciate how much effort you put into it, and we're grateful for your feedback.\n\nRegarding your difficulty finding an opponent, it sounds like you got a bit unlucky. The Steam stats certainly aren't great, but the vast majority of Wands players these days are on Quest and Quest 2. You can check www.wandsgame.com/ongoing-matches/ to see if anybody is playing right now. As I write this, there are 10 players dueling and one looking for an opponent. Thanks again for your feedback. We hope you can find an opponent next time!",
