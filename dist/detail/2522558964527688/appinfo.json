The main course of this update is the first ever DLC “Electro Party”, a music pack that takes you into a wild party with upbeat electronic music, vibrant moving elements, and electricity. A lot of electricity! This new album features a dark environment that resembles an epic disco stage, something widely demanded by the OhShape community. The Electro Party music pack includes 8 new songs:\n\n-\"Attack\" by Red City Hero\n-\"Detonate\" by Stretched\n-\"Is This All There\" by Arch Tremors\n-\"Keeping Love Alive\" by Guest of Rapture\n-\"Pump Up The Bass\" by Fassounds\n-\"Radio Love\" by Tyler Fiore\n-\"Save Me\" by Kiba\n-\"The One\" by Fassounds\n\nThe Electro Party DLC is available for $2.99 on the Oculus Quest and Steam, with the PSVR version coming soon at the same price.\n\n\nChallenges in Oculus Quest\n\nFrom now on, Quest players will also enjoy the Challenges feature where each week they will be able to join 2 exclusive challenges with different songs and modifiers, each featuring a different leaderboard. Players can compete on the global leaderboard and can challenge a friend to beat their score. Let the true competition begin!\n\n\nNewcomers welcome!\n\nThe Odders Lab team has been doing a deep research around the feedback received from the community and some adjustments have been made so the new players can have a better experience with OhShape. There is a new difficulty naming that provides a clearer information about the challenge and the skills the player needs to master each level.\n\n",

I have no issues with any other Quest 2 game and I have most music related games now. \n\nAlso, please can we get more varied environments?\n\nI look forward to future updates and mew features.\n\nThank you.",

We are reviewing the visual and audio feedback of the game to make it feel better (right now you will see a grey flash when you fail a wall but this will be improved). If you have tried all the suggestions, we recommend you to start playing on easier difficulties and play around with modifiers (speed and precision). You can also experiment with no fail mode and practice mode. If you still struggle with the poses or you feel a clumsy gameplay, please send us two videos of you playing OhShape (one video of the gameplay, recorded with Quest 2, and another video of you playing the exact same gameplay). That way we could analyze if there is a problem between your gestures and the gam. You can send this to info@odderslab.com\n\nAbout the different environments, we are working on new stages that you will see in future updates!",
