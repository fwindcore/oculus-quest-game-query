The people have been great. This game does have an issue with people who are too young. I have ran into multiple 12ish year olds, who constantly talk, constantly mess around and a few people that go all in at the very start which is very Frustrating as no one is able to play properly then. Personally due to lack of action towards this I think that a vote kick feature should be introduced. That way the players can deal with them. \n\nFinally I would like to suggest a Tutorial on how to play poker. I know how to due to being taught by my dad but I’d like to have access to a refresher course type thing or for new players they could learn.\n\nOverall I think this is an amazing game and can be really fun. I hope the dev take into account what I’ve said. Thank you for your time.",
