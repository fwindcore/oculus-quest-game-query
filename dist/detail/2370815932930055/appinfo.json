When the game crashes it stops instantly and tilts about 30 degrees it actually painful and unsettling at the least . When you crash they can refund your buy ins but not a weeks worth of playing . DO NOT buy their chips they can drain rather quickly and how ever much they say the RNG is legit . Deal a few poker hands at home you’ll never see trips, flushes , straights in the same hand , you’ll see this very often in this game that’s designed to drain your chip count quickly . Tried game when it first came out amd deleted . Deleted again recently for the same reasons .",
