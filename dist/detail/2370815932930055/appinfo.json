On top of that, look at games where someone is on fire. This one person, out of 8 people at a table, wins 3/5 games. I’ve had multiple instances where I didn’t win a single hand in 15+ hands. I even lost in a 1v1 in spin and go because I literally either had a draw hand or lost 15+ hands in a row. \n\nDevs can deny it all they want, but the game is rigged. Gameplay proves it in multiple ways.",

You are saying the game is rigged but yet you are implying that because someone won 3 out of 5 matches.  If it was set that someone different won every time, that would be considered rigged and we have never nor will we ever participate in such unethical behavior.  Sometimes it isn't about what cards you have but how you play them.  If you need any on strategies or ranges, we have a very knowledgeable community that can help share some advice to help you along the way.  Here is a little info about our RNG.  The PokerStars VR Random Number Generator (RNG) has been certified by iTech Labs, one of the leading accredited testing laboratories for online gaming worldwide. iTech Labs  has found that the card sequences in PokerStars VR are unpredictable, non-repeatable and uniformly distributed. The PokerStars VR RNG Certificate may be found here: \nhttps://itechlabs.com/certificates/luckyvr/RNG_Certificate_UK_LuckyVRInc_10Dec19.pdf\nWe hope your luck changes for the better and we hope you leave us an updated review to express your experience about our game as a whole, thank you.",
