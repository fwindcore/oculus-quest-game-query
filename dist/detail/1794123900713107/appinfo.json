							"reviewDescription": "A hacker stealth game that feels and looks like Watch_Dogs and Splinter Cell had a child in a hospital where VR games are born. Your view of the game is via CCTV cameras that you have hacked, giving you higher control of the facility around you as you progress. Your overall mission is to help a recently locked up girl called Hope escape from her captivity while learning some pretty alarming secrets along the way. You indirectly control Hope by aiming at structures and items around her (tasers, pepper spray, collectables, items of intel etc.) - all while avoiding being caught by the armed guards.\n\nThe game is very story-driven, each person and item in the game has a story behind it, so if you’re into the deeper stories of the worlds your games are set in then République has a lot to offer. The graphics are decent enough and consistent regardless of what is being rendered. It's hard to explain the game without giving too many spoilers but what’s exciting about the gameplay is that you are only an observer, Hope’s reactions to the world and people around her are limited to your direction, so if you make a mistake you have a limited time to correct it before Hope is caught and your mission is failed – however, if you take the time and plan out your next moves, things should mostly go your way.\n\nRépublique brings a fresh perspective to the world of VR games and offers as many opportunities as it does limitations to unique gameplay. If you aren’t a fan of stealth titles then the only other pillar you can lean on is the story, since the hacking and action elements aren’t enough to keep you invested on their own and there aren’t too many style mix-ups to keep you on your toes. But for fans of the genres, République is a solid title with plenty of polish and optimised well for the various headsets it supports.\n\nRead the full review and more here: https://www.opiumpulses.com/article/315/10-oculus-quest-new-release-reviews-p3",
