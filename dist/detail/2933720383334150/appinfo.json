							"reviewDescription": "We should start by saying this one is not a game and more a short film / immersive experience. However, that does not in any way make it not worthy of anyone’s attention, gamer or not! Without ruining any of the plot, Gloomy Eyes paints the picture of a very dark word, with very little light and scary, twisted characters. The whole experience is focused on telling the story from your unique point of view, almost although you’re a camera or higher being, watching the moments unfold in front of you. Scenes rise and swing into your focus, allowing you to see the small detail of characters’ expressions and the drearily beautiful world they inhabit.\n\nThe art, atmosphere and music could be described as the work of Tim Burton, H. P. Lovecraft and Stranger Things inspired creators, the characters wouldn’t look out of place in The Nightmare Before Christmas. The design alone is not solely where this game shines, the story, the narration, the way lighting is used, the way the dark and depressing atmosphere is penetrated by the hope and love of the characters who’s complicated relationship builds an almost continuous smile upon your face during your time spent watching. An absolute joy, start to finish – even if we couldn’t help wishing there were some interactive moments.\n\nIf we had to nit-pick, we’d say that snap turning would be appreciated for those who choose or have to watch this seated, you either need to be stood up or sat in a swivel chair to experience it without hurting your neck and even them sometimes scenes formed too close or too far away resulting in you having to back up. Besides this, the textures used in scenes where you are watching very closely sometimes left a lot to be desired, however, the game is just too beautiful to cry over spilt milk. As huge Burton fans, Gloomy Eyes resonated with us in a big way, lighting up an easy score of 5/5.\n\nRead the full review and more here: https://www.opiumpulses.com/article/417/10-more-oculus-quest-game-reviews-p3",
