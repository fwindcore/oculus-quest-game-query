							"reviewDescription": "This is something I've been pretty much waiting my whole life to play. An arcade racer, set in a neo futuristic setting. The game is pretty bare bones as far as presentation goes, but it gets the job done. The game runs really smoothly and is easy to play. I'm not great with motion sickness, and after five races had to take a break. Pro tip: Although it steers off of one controller, hold both out in front of you as though you were holding a steering wheel, when you corner turn your head and hands in that direction. You'll feel a lot less sick, and a lot more like you're in the game. It's a cheap game, and it offers good short bursts of fun. The engine sounds could be better.\n\nEdit: I discovered that you can make your helmet viewing area smaller, this really helps the motion sickness.\n\nNote to developer: Make the engine's sound powerful, instead of a low hum, add a 3.2.1 robotic countdown at the beginning of the race and some better upbeat music and I'll give this a straight five.",
