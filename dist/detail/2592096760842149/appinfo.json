							"body_text": "\n\nHello all!\n\nIt's been a month since the last big update to 2MD: VR Football, and we're extremely humbled by the positive response that many of you have taken the time to share with us.  April is upon us, and with the new month comes a small but substantial gameplay update, along with another fun new addition!  So, without further ado, let's get started!\n\n\n\nManual Receiver Mode is Here!\n\nThat's right -- now you have the option of running the ball when you complete ANY pass or hand-off!  By toggling the new \"receiver mode\" slider in the locker room from \"CPU\" to \"Manual,\" any completed pass will instantaneously transport you to the target player with possession of the ball.\n\nAfter a brief 1 second pause to let you gather your bearings, the action resumes, and it'll be your job to run your route and stiff arm opponents along the way.\n\nWhen in manual receiver mode, your movement is faster than the default QB, although you still cannot flat outrun the defense -- the key here will be to design plays to minimize defensive coverage and create the ideal scenario for maximum yardage gains.  Stats will be adjusted to reflect rush gains and touchdowns for manual receiver mode as well.\n\n\n\nChampionship Stadium\n\nWe're also excited to reveal a new stadium addition to 2MD.  Championship field will now be revealed when you reach round 7, exclusively decked out for the championship game.\n\nLastly, we've made a few additional small updates and improvements to other stadiums in the game, along with some other behind the scenes improvements.\n\nYour support helps 2MD, and it really goes without saying that the best way to see the features you want to see is to spread the word and help us grow the game's audience so that we can continue to provide increasing levels of ongoing support.  \nIf you like 2MD, leave us a review, or reach out to us on twitter @truantpixel to tell us what you think!\n\nTake care, and as always, thanks for playing our game!",

							"title": "March update:  DUMMYVISION takes the field!",
							"created_time": 1614402848,
							"body_text": "\n\n\nHello again!\n\nIt hasn't even been a month since our big game overhaul, and we still have tons of updates to roll out!  So, without further ado, let's get started:\n\nDUMMYVISION returns to 2MD!\n\n\nA big part of the original game on PC platforms was the DUMMYVISION 3rd person broadcast camera, which gave player's an after-the-snap birds-eye view of the action.  Thanks to some seriously creative resource management, we've been able to squeeze it back onto the quest platform in all its glory!  Dummy League games now feature the in-game spectator display on all fields, giving you even more nail-biting moments as the ball sails toward your receivers.\n\nVariable weather now affects on-field physics!\n\n\nWhile DUMMYVISION is exclusive to Dummy League games, Robot League games get their own exclusive feature -- inclement weather conditions can now affect elements like ball trajectory in very subtle fashion, adding to the challenge and even providing an edge in certain circumstances!  The key here will be paying attention to the new orange windsocks atop the goalposts when variable weather is present (wind, snow, or rain).\n\nEven more graphical improvements\n\n\nWhile we continue to scour every corner of 2MD for feasible updates and upgrades, we're continually improving things like model optimization and texture resolution.  This newer update will include even more texture enhancements for elements with varying material properties (metal, jerseys) and on-field elements like grass and turf will pop with even more clarity.\n\nUpdate board in the locker room!\n\n\nWe've added an update board to the locker room in place of the original leaderboard (that's been moved to just above the statboard behind you, so no more whipping your head back and forth to check stats with leaderboard metrics!).  We'll update this new noticeboard every time we push a change, so you'll quickly know what's been added to 2MD.\n\nA league of their own!\n\nYou may have noticed at this point we're started referring to Dummy and Robot 'leagues'.  This differentiation highlights how unique each play type has become as the game continues to evolve, beyond the simple visual difference:  Dummy League is what we now consider the entry point: a level playing field, where you can hone your strategy with a consistent challenge progression from game-to-game. Robot League, meanwhile, now represents a greater challenge given the omission of an overhead display and the added variables of inclement weather which can occur with both predictable and unpredictable fashion .\n\nWe've got even more updates planned, but for now let us know how you what you think of these improvements!  Your support helps 2MD, and it really goes without saying that the best way to see the features you want to see is to spread the word and help us grow the game's audience so that we can continue to provide increasing levels of ongoing support.  Take care, and as always, thanks for playing our game!",

I liked the game when I bought it and they keep giving me new reasons to play. I have other games I’ve purchased where it’s obvious the devs have moved on to something else. \n\nIf you have even a slight interest in this game you should buy",
