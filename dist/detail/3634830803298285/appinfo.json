Feral rats have begun to appear, and the rumors among the locals suggest that they’re being steered by someone… or something. It's time to delve deep into the sewers beneath Sunderhaven to locate the source of this mysterious scourge and eliminate it by any means necessary.\n\nThe new update includes:\n- New environment: The sewers are dark and very dangerous. With endless threats lurking in the shadows, adventurers will want to stick together if they’re going to survive.\n- New enemies: Spore Fungus are filled to the brim with poison, so be sure to watch your step — and don’t let the multi-headed Gorgon catch your gaze, or you might just turn to stone!\n- New cards: Brighten your way with the trusty Torch card, treat any poisons with the new Antitoxin and go on the offensive with your brand new Web Bomb.\n- New boss: The Rat King is the last monster you’d want to be trapped with when you’re five levels underground, but that’s exactly where you’ll find this horrifying monarch that is literally bound to his subjects.\n- We've also added bug fixes and balancing tweaks to make the game experience even better.\n\nGood luck, adventurer. You may very well need it.\n\nJoin our Discord server to find new friends to play with.\nFollow us on Twitter for even more Demeo updates.",

Other reviews hit on the many positives. \n\nRegarding single player, these are the few suggestions I have after several hours of gameplay:\n\n- A save game feature would be useful for solo play for those who can only play in short bursts. \n- Being able to pick the classes of the other two team members would be useful to create some replay variety. \n- Currently there doesn’t seem to be a way to get back to the main menu once you pick single player without restarting, but maybe I’m just not finding it. \n\nOnce again, this is a fantastic game and I plan on spending many more hours playing.",
