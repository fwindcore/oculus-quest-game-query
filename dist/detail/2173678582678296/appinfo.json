The projector will still show when you're holding your MakerPen, or until the recording is finalized.\n\n## General Improvements\n\n- Fixed a bug that caused some maker pen sound effects to sound distant or even inaudible at times.\n- Improved badging in the messages menu so it's easier to tell which messages and notifications are unread.\n- Visiting the notifications tab in the messages menu now clears the unread notifications badge.\n- Improved presentation of creator announcements in the messages menu.\n- Fixed not being able to save the grenades in clones of \\^LaserTag.\n- Fixed photo roll resetting position after cheering a photo.\n- Fixed the cheer count display for photos in photo roll.\n- Fixed a bug where join room buttons in room details screens could become disabled when cancelling out of the room warnings popup.\n- No longer displaying the room warnings popup from the room details screens (they already show room warnings).\n\n## Beta Content Changes\nWe are migrating to a new style for variable chips:\n\n- These include get _and_ set functionality in one chip.\n- There will be one chip for each type in the palette that can be configured local or synced.\n- Old style variable chips, along with `Set Value` will eventually go away.\n\nOther changes:\n\n- `Player Definition Board` can now be used to create logic on players.\n- One `Player Definition Board` in each room can be set to Active from the Configuration menu.\n- All nodes within that board will be copied into a `Player Reference Board` on each player who joins the room...\n- Type names now appear above ports when hovering them with the wire tool.\n- Many math nodes now work with `Vector3`s: `Add Node`, `Divide Node`, `Multiply Node`, `Subtract Node`\n- We now support adding and removing from lists with up to 50 elements!\n\nAs always, thanks for playing Rec Room!\n\nPlease see here for convenient links to controls, tutorials, comfort options, etc.: https://recroom.com/community\nWe love to hear your feedback, so please don't hesitate to let us know what you think...",

We were bombarded with insults and swears, we were banned and vote kicked for no reason, we were no mach for the army of little kid that got grounded from fortnight and stumbled upon this app. The devs released this game on consul. The community was ruined, the games were ransacked by toxic nine year olds who’s parents left them unmonitored and these kids don’t have any act-right. And finally, the game was ruined. Devs, please make it so vr players can only play with other vr players and consul players can only play with other consul players. MAKE THIS GAME AS AWESOME AS IT WAS BEFORE. \n\n\n    please.",
