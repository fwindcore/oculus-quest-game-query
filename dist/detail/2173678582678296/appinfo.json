These are my rules i’ve found work in rec room.\nFirst thing- when you load in- take the time to navigate settings and adjust them to your liking. Go to experience then go to personal bubble and type off. The way to do actions like friend people is by high fiving/ fist bumping/ and shaking hands. You can also check play with adult players only which only halfway works\nSecond- you teleport? Maybe this isn’t the game for you tbh. You’ll get called a cheater a lot because level 50s do it to get a jump on competition in dodgeball\nThird- the rec center button doesn’t work\nRemember that\nDon’t push it\nPretend\nFourth- there’s a search bar and you can find really awesome games in the play menu, however it’s kinda hard to navigate first time\nIf new\nClick filters and go to originals\nAnd play any “quest”\nRise of jumbotron (robot murdering rampage)\nGolden trophy (goblins galore)\nCrescendo of the blood moon (genuinely creepy but doesn’t work on quest 2)\nCrimson cauldron (what’s that sound coming from the swamp)\nIsland pirate one or whatever I don’t play it (a three person sword/ musket fight where blocking a slash stuns enemies and anything can be used as a weapon)\nFifth- LEARN TO BUILD\nIF YOU DON’T KNOW TRY TO FIND AN EVENT\nMe and my friends now live in a massive mansion with moving cars below and all our rooms are decorated with our stuff- we built it from scratch and we all spawn in there when we turn rec room on so I’ll run into my friend just casually editing some stuff in the living room and the other shooting hoops when i turn it on. We spent a mere 7 hours in a row\nSixth- This game is not that childish\nIf your kid’s getting this game I suggest not\nKids are poisoning this game, however i made one cry the other day by shooting him over and over in a pvp room.\nLast but not least- NEVER AND I MEAN NEVER UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES GO TO A FURRY EVENT IF YOU ARE ACTUALLY A FURRY i’m not but like\nEven i can see how bad it is\nThat’s where the most slurs and racist jokes are hurled at people otherwise they usually keep it on the low\n\n\nWell now get started or get back playing again because it’s a lot of fun\nEvery time I play i feel like pissing myself laughing and once you get good (took me a month to double arrow shot and learn to build) it’s just a blast and every-time I log in it takes away the crippling stack of hw in front of me and the sad lonely life in which I lead\nJk lol",
