The projector will still show when you're holding your MakerPen, or until the recording is finalized.\n\n## General Improvements\n\n- Fixed a bug that caused some maker pen sound effects to sound distant or even inaudible at times.\n- Improved badging in the messages menu so it's easier to tell which messages and notifications are unread.\n- Visiting the notifications tab in the messages menu now clears the unread notifications badge.\n- Improved presentation of creator announcements in the messages menu.\n- Fixed not being able to save the grenades in clones of \\^LaserTag.\n- Fixed photo roll resetting position after cheering a photo.\n- Fixed the cheer count display for photos in photo roll.\n- Fixed a bug where join room buttons in room details screens could become disabled when cancelling out of the room warnings popup.\n- No longer displaying the room warnings popup from the room details screens (they already show room warnings).\n\n## Beta Content Changes\nWe are migrating to a new style for variable chips:\n\n- These include get _and_ set functionality in one chip.\n- There will be one chip for each type in the palette that can be configured local or synced.\n- Old style variable chips, along with `Set Value` will eventually go away.\n\nOther changes:\n\n- `Player Definition Board` can now be used to create logic on players.\n- One `Player Definition Board` in each room can be set to Active from the Configuration menu.\n- All nodes within that board will be copied into a `Player Reference Board` on each player who joins the room...\n- Type names now appear above ports when hovering them with the wire tool.\n- Many math nodes now work with `Vector3`s: `Add Node`, `Divide Node`, `Multiply Node`, `Subtract Node`\n- We now support adding and removing from lists with up to 50 elements!\n\nAs always, thanks for playing Rec Room!\n\nPlease see here for convenient links to controls, tutorials, comfort options, etc.: https://recroom.com/community\nWe love to hear your feedback, so please don't hesitate to let us know what you think...",
