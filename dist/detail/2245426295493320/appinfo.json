It's vr, we want to duel wield pistols and hold your awesome guns with two hands. Please don't be the next victim of 2020. I'm not refunding. I'm putting my faith in the development team to make it right. Stop saying it's that way \"by design\" to complaints that everyone is making. It's not helping. Who ever is in charge of responding to reviews- have a long in depth talk about turning this game around with the devs. This isn't pre season. It's Beta maybe Alpha level. Fix it before you're forgotten by all the new games coming. I want a good reason to come back to a game I invested in. I'm playing and enjoying what's there but it's like dating a really hot girl with a really low IQ, it's not gonna last. \n\nUpdate- the added hand tracking is nice. Unfortunately I spend more time waiting for a game to start waiving with both hands at the few players on each server then actually playing. Looking forward to the Christmas gifts bolstering the community. I struggle with the decisions of the developers and I know they always have their reasons, so for people actually reading this whole review, you should know it's very fun and the core community is great.",
