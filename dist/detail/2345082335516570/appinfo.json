There is a 50/50 chance the 4yo wants me to grab and throw her vs. actually wanting to get an acorn, but hey :D  The companion phone app is easy to use and controls pretty well!  The variety in the stages is good enough to give us an hour of play time per-session w/o feeling repetitive.  If you are more competitive and are playing as the Tree, you can give the squirrels AI companions.\n\nGripe about the phone app: you can't control the camera, and it always points towards the tree.  This is GREAT to make the app simple enough for younger ones to play, but makes it frustrating when you are trying to see what you fell through or got suck on on some of the more elaborate stages.  Otherwise, yes, it's great and it works very well.",
