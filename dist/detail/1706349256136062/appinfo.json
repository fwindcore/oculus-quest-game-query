							"reviewDescription": "I was very hesitant about buying this game, I mean come on, it’s a $30 horror game that looks like it has bad graphics. When I tell you I was SO wrong I mean it. The story to this game is unbelievably fascinating, you’re set in the comic universe where you find your way back to your home town after a car crash, and there are creatures that try to kill you. What more do you want!? The comic book aesthetic makes this game what it is. You have to limit your ammo, fight with axes and a bunch of other melee weapons against these scary creatures, and reserve the food you get that gives you health. Physics are amazing, I’ve faced absolutely no bugs or glitches. And to make matters better, it’s 6-8 hours of gameplay depending on what difficulty you’re on. That means hours and hours of fun and awesome gameplay. There are a few jump scares here and there but they’re not scary to the point where you want to take your headset off. You WILL get invested in the game and only want to play this until you finish the game. This is a MUST BUY GAME. I kid you not, this is the first ever game I’ve ever said “This game is awesome” and “Sick!” to out loud while I was playing it.You feel like a total bada$$ but still are a little creeped out from the scary creatures and the unsettling music in the background. If you are hesitant or even DON’T WANNA BUY THE GAME.. GET IT. It’s super fun and fascinating to even non-horror fans. It’s the perfect mix between not so scary and scary. Even when your heart drops from a scary scene you’ll still wanna play, because you’re just that invested! Not to mention how immersive this game is. You feel like you are Mae, the main character. I have absolutely nothing bad to say about this game.All in all, even if you’re not thinking about buying the game or don’t know if you should spend your hard-earned money on it, buy it. Right now! I promise from the bottom of my heart you won’t regret it.",
