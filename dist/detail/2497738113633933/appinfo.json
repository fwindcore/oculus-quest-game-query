							"reviewDescription": "there are quite a few things holding back this application from being fun for more than one person … let’s start at the top.\n\nwell the push to talk idea is good for communicating with other people in common areas like the lobby… By time you find the button people have walked away. You see a lot of dis joint things going on like people drawing and moving their hands around… This really didn’t get the social interaction perfect but it’s good enough if you know the people you’re talking to I suppose. The lobby experience in general is kind of cool but feels like a demo since you have no control over the content or the people you bump into. More on that later…\n\nlet’s talk about the rooms.\n\neverybody gets their own room. Unfortunately if you want to keep it private it’s near impossible to share that experience with other people through the UI today. you are given a unique ID for the room which you can’t edit … which is not possible to remember and you are told to use the room you must share it with somebody. Well there is no mechanism for adding friends that I could find so how are we supposed to share it? I am on Oculus and I decided to try to send it via messenger to my friend. So much for that cross account messenger thing. it did not show up in any messages. if it did… I can’t imagine the application switching hell I would be in trying to get that string from the social messaging app into big screen.  why can’t I create my own room name as long as it’s unique and share that with people? I’m sure I could think of something that would be easy to remember and type.\n\nnot that there is any reason to join somebody’s room. The only way you can watch a movie easily through purchasing it on their store (rental only) actually requires everybody to rent it at the same time. from the beginning of movie rentals in the 70s… Nobody has implemented a rule this stupid where everybody who wants to watch the video tape has to also pay the rental fee.  The room is limited to four people… So it’s naturally limiting any type of issue where 100 people get to watch a movie for five dollars. this likely calls for a Steve Jobs style negotiation to solve with the idiot RIAA. i’m not holding my breath.\n\nOK… So how easy is it to rent a movie for all these people?￼￼\n\nwhen you click buy… it actually sends you an email link and you have to go through and purchase it through your email. now I’m taking off my headset going over to my computer with my email client and waiting a few minutes for the email to show up. you must be kidding me. despite all the credit cards I typed into the system so far… They manage to ask me to type in a credit card number again. It didn’t seem to offer PayPal either.  \n\nso now I go back into the room and I still see the screen where it’s asking me to rent the movie. So I click rent again. Then it tells me to go to my email again. they managed to send me email twice, but they didn’t manage to make the application react to my purchase by closing the purchase dialogue. This dialogue acts somewhat like a system model dialogue there’s no easy way to dismiss it without using the Oculus key to escape it. The workflow is completely broken.\n\nso I dismiss the rental dialogue and I noticed that if I scroll down to an area that is half displayed I can see that the movie has been rented and I can start watching it.  this is where I got the shock of my life when I figured out anybody else who wanted to watch the movie had to pay an additional five dollars.. \n\nOK OK let’s try the video player this must work.\n\nI have a Plex server set up with DNLA.  I browsed to a movie and started watching it.  my friends movie screen was blank.  at some weird point a warning came up explaining that I was watching a movie and if they wanted to watch a movie too they must find it on their hard drive.  this was an awesome experience… If you try to browse for files in the oculus headset you actually start seeing the android system. even on the android phones it’s tricky to put stuff on the file system but in the oculus of course, there is no way I know of to put movies into standard folders on the android system.  right but this is DNLA…\n\nindeed I was able to browse to the movie on the DN LA server from both headsets and play the movie.   finally… A way we can watch the movie together!￼￼￼\n\nexcept it didn’t sync the movie.. really – I’m not kidding you. we were both watching at different times.  somehow they didn’t think it was enough to prove that both headsets had access to the same movie and share from the one headset… 123 watch!!!!\n\nso the experience of creating a room and sharing content is pretty much nonexistent. given all the attention to detail spent creating the rooms the popcorn and the drinks and all that cool stuff… It is unimaginable that they didn’t figure out how to allow us to watch a movie at the same time.\n\nif you go into the lobby where they have a very cool social VR set up you can do some cool things go into one of only four theaters sit down and watch something that is basically free content with other people. I imagine it’s possible to coordinate what you watch with your friends and do it that way… But in this case you have virtually no control over the content.\n\nThe only reason this isn’t a one star review is because it’s in beta and I am guessing none of these issues is unknown and everybody wants to solve them there. However until they do, you’re just going to have to figure out another way to watch movies together with your friends.   my guess is the Discord client would be a much much better solution for that.",
