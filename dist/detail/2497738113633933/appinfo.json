I really liked the community... well sometimes a lot of kids would join quiet movies and talk a lot but you can always mute them. I didn’t like doing this because it took me away from the conversations. I never had a bad time playing the game but I do have one complaint. To go to movies that aren’t stream by other players you have to pay a fee to get in. It’s also worth noting that the theaters movies that they besides Top Gun or World War Z are mostly bad. But if you join the other peoples room you can be prepared for a good show.",
