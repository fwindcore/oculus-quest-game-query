							"reviewDescription": "I love Bigscreen, it’s definitely one of my favorite apps on VR. But I’m a little disappointed with inability to share movies. I can pay money to see one of the featured movies with a friend, but if I want to invite a friend over to my virtual living room to watch one of my movies on my server, it won’t work. My friend has to have that same movie on their server. Why? What would be the point in that? Maybe I’m doing something wrong, I’ve tried to see if there’s a workaround for this. So far, nothing. But if you can collaborate and share your files on your pc in a work related setting on Bigscreen, why couldn’t I watch a movie with a friend who doesn’t have the same movie? They can’t record it, download it...it’s not breaking any laws. It’s no different than buying the movie at a store, taking it home and watching it with my friends there. During this quarantine, my friends and I have been finding out what movies we haven’t seen and watching them. It would have been nice to share a movie with friend that I have, that they don’t have. Just hoping this is something that gets fixed. It doesn’t make sense and makes the whole idea of watching movies with friends limited to purchasing tickets for one of the handful of movies I really have no interest in seeing. Maybe if they played newly released movies that would be in the theaters, that would be better. I’d probably do that more often.",
