And with the tech capabilities of Quest 2, we finally had room to make further improvements to our graphics: anti-aliasing, 72 fps, and 90Hz refresh rate!\n\nAll of this will significantly improve the HOLOFIT graphics and make the experience overall smoother! Enjoy it!\n\nNew Songs on our Playlists\n\nWe’re sure you already have your favorite songs from our playlists, here’s a chance to get new favorites! We have added 5 - 10 songs to each of the playlists, we’ll keep adding more in the future. Enjoy!\n\nNew Freestyle Avatars in Underwater, Saturn, and Cambridge\n\nAre you using HOLOFIT Freestyle? If yes, then you’ll definitely notice the cool new avatars in Underwater, Saturn, and Cambridge. Now - go, go, go!\n\nConcept 2 Bike Ergs Now Works directly with HOLOFIT\n\nWe’ve tested the Bike Ergs, and enabled your C2 PM5 Bike Erg to work with HOLOFIT without the need for an additional cadence sensor. We’d appreciate your feedback if you happen to have the bike erg. \nThank you!\n\nWe will also start testing the Concept2 Ski Erg, if you have one and would like to help us with testing please just let us know!\n\nVarious Bug Fixes and Improvements\n- Music player fixes\n- New Internet error visual feedback\n- New keyboard\n\nFinally, we’d like to thank you for your support: we appreciate it very much, and we’ve loved being on this journey with you.\n\nP.S.

							"body_text": "Hello everyone! It’s been a little less than one week since we’ve officially launched on the Oculus store, and we’ve been patiently reading all of your feedback. Thank you all!\n\nWe’d love to thank our existing members who gave us positive reviews, we appreciate it very much. Thank you for your patience as we worked to get to the store!\n\nMoreover, we’d love to thank newcomers for checking out HOLOFIT and giving constructive feedback, we always use it to improve our development roadmap.\n\nWe’ve also seen many questions since launch, so we are addressing those in this short post.\n\nWhy a subscription?\nBecause it’s the only way we can continue to bring monthly upgrades and updates to our community. Something new to motivate you to work out, every single month.\n\nWe are not a gaming company, we are a fitness company that uses gaming to push our users’ fitness to new highs. Subscription is a standard in the fitness industry, whether it’s the monthly membership you pay at your gym, your Peloton monthly membership subscription, or the monthly fee you pay for your Apple Fitness+.\n\nIt doesn’t work with my rowing machine/ bike/ elliptical.\n\nHOLOFIT connects to fitness machines over Bluetooth and not all machines work with HOLOFIT right out of the box. In some cases, you would need to add a cadence sensor to your elliptical/bicycle to enable a Bluetooth connection. \nPlease note that cadence sensors don’t work with rowing machines.\n\nCompatible rowing machines:\n- Concept 2 PM5\n- WaterRower with SmartRow or ComModule add-on\n- StairMaster HIIT rower\n- TechnoGym SkillRow\n- Domyos 500 rowing machine\n\nCompatible bikes:\n- Any bike with the additional cadence sensor\nOur recommendation: IGPSport C61 sensor\n\nCompatible elliptical machines:\n- Any wheel-based elliptical machine. The cadence sensor has to spin in a circular motion for it to work.\n\nWhat if I don’t have a fitness machine? \nYou can use HOLOFIT Freestyle with Oculus controllers to simulate rowing, running, and cycling using bodyweight exercises.\n\nIf your avatar is going too slow, pick up the pace! You really need to be swinging those arms, engaging your core and shoulders to go faster :)\n\nCan I use HOLOFIT Freestyle on my non-listed rowing machine?\nSome of our members use HOLOFIT Freestyle on their rowing machines by attaching the Oculus controllers on the rowing handlebar. However, note that your workout data won’t be as precise as when using HOLOFIT with the rowing machine.\n\nWe are preparing an update that would enable head tracking for this purpose so that you don’t have to attach the controllers to the handlebar.\n\nThe workout data shown in HOLOFIT is not accurate. \nWhen there is a direct connection between HOLOFIT and your rowing machine, there shouldn’t be any significant discrepancies between that data that your machine reports and the data HOLOFIT reports.\n\nHowever, if you have noticed a major discrepancy, please email support@holodia.com and let us know.\n\nThe Freestyle mode with Oculus controllers is moving really slowly for me. Am I doing something wrong?\n\nOur goal is to make you have a proper workout, and we do this by making you move as much as possible. HOLOFIT Freestyle tracks your hand controllers, and if your avatar is going too slow, pick up the pace!\n\nYou really need to be swinging those arms, engaging your core, arms, and shoulders to go faster :) And don’t forget about your legs. Engage your quads and your calves when running or cycling, by squatting and maybe even squat pulsing. Video tutorial here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpqpaSzTxO8\n\nWhat are the plans for the future? \nWe are preparing new worlds, new levels, new Freestyle workouts, new music and new Multiplayer challenges. And much more, but we will keep it as a surprise for now :)\n\nIs hand-tracking coming?\nYes!\n\nWhat about Google Fit/ Apple Health and other 3rd party fitness app integrations?\nThis will be a part of one of our next updates, currently under development.\n\nI don’t like the graphics.\nWe have a specific graphic style, it is an animated, original creation coming from our development team. You might love it (or maybe love it less), and we appreciate all your feedback and comments.\n\nWe are constantly working on improving graphics performance and quality, while still keeping our recognizable style.\n",

You’re going to see mixed reviews on this so let me explain why that may be - Expectations.  \n\nAt first I was a little disappointed because I thought it would be like a real world. All of it is animation. It’s kind of like the old Viewmaster. But let me tell you this app does exactly what I want. It distracts me. I don’t own any machines at all, I just use it to walk in place and listen to my music of choice. \n\nThis app provides the exact distraction that I need to make 30 minutes go by very fast. I’m looking around at some really cool worlds and there are some great surprises... like a giant whale jumping over my head. Or a crocodile jumping out to scare me. I have walked through the worlds several times and always notice something new. As far as I know there is no other app like this one. Go in there knowing that the graphics are not the greatest in the world and go in there knowing that you’re just going to have fun looking around at what the developers have in store for you. There are lots of fun surprises! I rate this app “worth it to me”!!;)",
