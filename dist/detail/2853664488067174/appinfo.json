							"body_text": "Hey HOLOFITTERS,\n\nThe new update is ready! üòç Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs new:\n\nIntroducing Freestyle skiing üéø\n\nA new Freestyle sport is here: welcome skiing, the new whole-body workout!\n\nArms, legs, back, butt, core - work it all while you ski through the amazing HOLOFIT worlds.\n\nSquat and swing your arms vigorously to get the most out of this one. You can burn up to 400 calories in a 30-minute session, although even doing it for 5 minutes will make a great impact on your muscles!\n\nHeadset tracking to enable controller-less rowing\n\nHeadset tracking is finally here! If you have a non-Bluetooth rowing machine, no need to attach your controllers to the handle anymore -\n\nGo into the HOLOFIT settings, select Fitness machine, and then select the Simple rower option, and you‚Äôre good to go!\n\nMany of you have been asking for this, and we‚Äôre very happy to be able to deliver! I hope you enjoy it üíñ\n\nRelax with the Zen Mode\n\nImmersive HOLOFIT worlds, amazing ambient music and sounds - and no distractions. Welcome, Zen mode!\n\nWe‚Äôve included a Zen mode switch in the Explore mode to enable total immersion where the only task is to relax and enjoy... Just you and the HOLOWORLD.\n\n\n\nGrand Sablon Desert Re-done\n\nNew trophies (no need to cramp your neck anymore :), adjusted graphics and additional assets, all for your better experience! We heard your feedback and went straight to work.\n\nWe‚Äôve also optimized our desert marathon for rowing machines! The ups and downs of the dunes in the desert should now be much, much easier for those of you on rowing machines.\n\nTry it and let us know!\n\nAdded Music Tracks\n\nAs always, you can expect new music! We‚Äôve added new tracks into our existing playlists, and we‚Äôre preparing a possible restructuring or addition of new music genres into HOLOFIT. We‚Äôll keep you posted!\n\nBugs & fixes\n\nFinally, we‚Äôve fixed numerous bugs as well as optimized some things in the background that should make for a smoother HOLOFIT experience!\n\nWhat‚Äôs next?\n\nGrand Sablon V2: we‚Äôll double up the Desert length, so you can do proper half-marathons.\n\nTrophies V2: We will start adding new huntables (trophies) and make them more interactive. This will mean a brand new gameplay to make your workouts even more fun!\n\nCyberpunk (coming this fall): we‚Äôve started working on bringing Cyberpunk environment to Quest! And we know you‚Äôre going to love it!\n\nChallenges and online events: We can see that you are enjoying our Spring Challenge so we have decided to organize them regularly. On top of that, expect many online events coming - it‚Äôs going to be loads of fun!\n\nAnd much more!!\n\nIf you have any questions, I am here to help - and as always, any feedback that you have would be much appreciated. I can‚Äôt wait to hear what you think!\n\nWe‚Äôve loved having you as part of the HOLOFIT community!\n\nEnjoy, \nTeam Holodia",

							"body_text": "It‚Äôs time to celebrate: the new HOLOFIT Go update is here!\n\nHere‚Äôs what‚Äôs new:\n\nNew HOLOWORLD: The Grand Sablon\nYou asked for longer, more endurance-focused, sporty environments, and we listened -\n\nwelcome the desert of Grand Sablon, our longest and most challenging environment so far!\n\nGrand Sablon will test your endurance in the toughest of conditions while you explore the great desert and improve your fitness.\n\nAlthough it is based on the longest foot race on Earth - a six-day, 251 km (156 mi) ultramarathon through Sahara desert, and is amazing to use for your elliptical or HOLOFIT Freestyle running, it is also a great challenge for rowers and bicyclists that want to test and improve their endurance.\n\nIn Version 1 of the Grand Sablon, you will have to go through almost 8 kilometers/5 miles of sand dunes, lush oasis, and surprising Egyptian Sphinx. Version 2 will double this length and is coming to you very soon.\n\nDid you know? The Marathon des Sables was the brainchild of French concert promoter Patrick Bauer who in 1984 traversed the Sahara desert on foot and alone. He covered 350 km (214 mi) in 12 days without encountering a single oasis or desert community along the way.\n\nMultiplayer Voice Chat\nThe first part of our Multiplayer rework is here: the lobby voice chat!\n\nWhen you enter the Online Multiplayer lobby and while waiting for the race to start, you‚Äôll now be able to talk to your competitors. This will enable you to discuss race length, environment selection, or anything else that is of interest. Please make sure you treat others the way you would want to be treated yourself!\n\nThe lobby is, for now, the only point where you can use this feature. However, we plan to enable voice chat for the race end, so you can review your scores, cheer on each other and have fun with your achievements.\n\nMore multiplayer updates coming soon!\n\nLowered CardioGoals Arch Sensitivity\nWe‚Äôve lowered the sensitivity of CardioGoals arches which may have given you problems. You‚Äôve told us that, in some cases, the arches were ‚Äútoo sensitive‚Äù.\n\nWe‚Äôve tested and agreed. Thank you for giving us your feedback on this, we appreciate the help!\n\nTime Attack Sounds Lowered\nAs we plan our full Time Attack rework for the next quarter, we wanted to provide a quick fix that many of you asked for:\n\nThe proximity sounds have now been lowered so as not to interfere with your session.\n\nWe‚Äôd love your feedback on this, try it out and let us know!\n\nNew Music\nAnother month brings around more new songs! \nWe‚Äôve added at least five new songs to each of the playlists. We hope that you enjoy it!\n\nIf you have preferences or genres you would like to hear, just let us know!\n\nNew Demo HOLOWORLD\nUsers who try HOLOFIT in the demo mode will now be able to test the mysterious world of Troglodyte!\n\nVarious Bugs & Fixes\nAs always, there are various bugs and fixes in this update including the HUD selection jitter and the unlocking of Freestyle for the users who were impacted.\n\nAs always, we‚Äôre looking forward to hearing your feedback on this update. And if you have any other questions, don‚Äôt hesitate to get in touch.\n\nP.S. If you haven't yet reviewed HOLOFIT, please leave a review here. We really appreciate it as it helps us spread the word about HOLOFIT.\n\nThank you, and stay HOLOFIT!",

The other environments are less exciting and will hopefully get updated soon. I give the app 3 stars for delivering what it‚Äôs selling, which is a virtual environment that tracks your strokes on a rower in VR. I would give it another star if the graphics were better. I would also give it another star if the environments were more interactive. I wish the environments had an objective like ‚Äúbeing a policeman and having to chase a thief through a downtown Manhattan‚Äù, or ‚Äúrunning away from a Tyrannosaurus Rex‚Äù like the Jeep chase scene in Jurassic Park.",
