							"reviewDescription": "Hi, I’ve been playing this game for a couple weeks now and it’s really fun if you get a good lobby and most of the time you do but occasionally you’ll be playing a game in a nice chilled out lobby and someone will just join going all in every single time before even seeing the flop and making that whole lobby virtually unplayable. Another situation I had about a week ago was that one guy entered a lobby and instantly started verbally attacking another player for no reason. Yes you can mute and freeze avatars but when a person is as vile as that guy was, we should have tho option to vote as a lobby to kick them out.\nAnother thing that I wish you could add is an age limit or tables specifically for kids, there are so many young children in this game who go around shouting and disturbing the beautiful, calm atmosphere you guys have created with the scenery and the music. Of course not all the kids in the game are like this but a vast majority are and it’s just a shame really. \n\nBut overall this is a great poker game and I love being able to sit down at a copper table and just relax and play some poker with my friends and other interesting people online, I have met so many interesting people through this game! It is so beautiful and honestly my favourite thing to sit down to after a long day at work or in classes, thanks for making it so nice and relaxing. So despite the things I mentioned, I’d still recommend this game since it is fun to play and depending on your timing, you’ll likely get to chat with some cool people.\n\nOn a seperate note, sorry if this would be too difficult to add but it would be really cool if this gam allowed us to use the built in hand tracking on the oculus quest and quest 2?",
