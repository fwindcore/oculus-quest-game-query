							"reviewDescription": "I’ve been holding off writing a review for awhile. I truly love playing this game. I play it every weekend. I usually play multiplayer because I love the horde mode and it’s even more fun when you play with others. My only problem for this game is that sometimes I can’t drop the weapon I’m holding it just sticks. I also noticed that whenever I reach wave 18 and if I get mobbed by zombies it seems like there’s a glitch or the game freezes up. My only other issue is with reloading my gun, lots of times it will say weapon malfunction or the gun tends load slowly. \n\nI also think we should be able to wear two guns at all times or maybe we could earn some of the heavier machine guns when we get to round 15, since that’s when things get intense. \nOther than that I love this game.\n\nOne more thing, it would be great if 3 to 4 people could play this game on multiplayer.\n\nUpdate: I still love this game, but what did you guys do on this new update. Multiplayer is all screwed up and I live for multiplayer. The game doesn't recognize when both players are in the game, instead, it tells us waiting for players. Hopefully, you'll have this issue fixed quickly. I spent so much time yesterday trying to play the game. This is my go to game, as I only like playing on multiplayer. So please 🙏 fix this quickly.\n\nUpdate: what’s going on with this game. I keep having issues on horde mode. The game keeps disconnecting players while playing the game. Each person will see that the other person has disconnected when that’s not the case. When can we get this fixed? No matter how many games I buy this is still my favorite go to game. I play this game more than any game on my quest.",
