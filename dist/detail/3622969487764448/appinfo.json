							"reviewDescription": "Fun gameplay on my YT channel:\nGet To Da Choppa VR\n\nYupitergrad on the Oculus Quest is a single player platforming game that is set upon a Russian space station, where you will need to navigate your way through a variety of obstacles that all seem to want to crush, squish or grind you to death!\n\nNavigation is managed through shooting out elasticated plungers and then using those to swing through the environment. It’s like if Spiderman and Mario got jiggy one night and their offspring was raised in Russia and then sent to space!\n\nOther than swinging around there isn’t really any other gameplay elements to speak of, other than the occasional button to interact with and the story is pretty thin although does have some nice humour to it.\n\nThe main story campaign has a steady difficulty curve as you progress and will take around 2 hours to complete and whilst it is great fun to actually play, there isn’t really any replay-ability or reason to go back and play it again.\n\nThat being said, there are time trial courses that have online leader boards and these are probably my favourite part of the game as they encourage you to improve your skills and they give you a reason to keep coming for more as you work to swing past the competition (you see what I did there).\n\nGraphically there is nothing to complain about as it looks good with the cel shaded style, which to be fair, always works well in VR.\n\nOverall this a fun albeit short game that is kind of a one and done for me and probably will be for most other people as well. I don’t think this is a bad thing as I did really enjoy playing this but just to keep your expectations in check.",
