For starters there are 10 brand new levels for Time Attack, full of new obstacles and challenges that have been tested by our best engineers and visionaries. If you play on Oculus Quest 2, you will be able to turn on glorious 120Hz mode! We also added some new pumping music to Time Attack and added option to move between Campaign and Time Attack.\n\nThis is not the last surprise we have for you, but at this point we must keep the rest of our work top secret or general Varnikov might exclude us from Komrades.\n\nCheck out the new update, and enjoy the game! Also, please stay tuned for our new announcements.\n\nStay safe Komrades!\n",
