The recent update removed the feature where you can move the map anywhere on your screen but keep it open. I'd lower the map so it wouldn't block my view but was easy to see and use at a glance. Now if I select a place on the map to visit, the first thing I see is the big map screen right in front of me, and I have to click to remove it before I can enjoy the surroundings. This really reduces the impact of a first impression of a place! Please bring back this feature! It seemed like a small thing at first but is becoming more and more frustrating.",
