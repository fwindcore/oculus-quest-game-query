If you're expecting what it delivers, it's a great app. \n\nTo clarify for any potential buyers: It's not true VR, nor can you \"wander\" in it - it is essentially Google maps streetview (not even Google Earth, which would have been much more VR like), the same experience that you may have had with Google cardboard.\n\nDon't get me wrong - the ability to zap to almost anywhere in the world, even via static 360 degree photos, is still a great technological marvel, and does have a level of immersion. It's only perhaps disappointing if you're expecting a proper \"magic of vr\" experience, wandering through places, which is understandable from their overselling description.",
