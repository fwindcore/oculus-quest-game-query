The  360º immersive experience shows the viewer the emotional strain caused by separation, conflict of cultures, generational differences, and dreams that are common among the Asian community. Dear Mom is also a campaign dedicated to appreciating mother figures through the act of gift-giving, and sharing experiences through virtual reality.\n\nAma's Momento not only celebrates Taiwanese art and culture, but also invites us into the special moments of the life of Director Awu Chen's grandmother, Ama, and her dream of building an art museum. Ama's Momento inspired the Taiwanese Ministry of Art and Culture to recognize her collection as being “Taiwan’s Most Valuable.”\n\n\"Heart-achingly thoughtful\" - LA Times\n\nWinner of IndieCade 2019, Location-Based & Live Play Award\nFinalist of VR For Change 2020, AlcoveVR Challenge\nhttps://www.amavr.com/\n\nLaunch Dear Mom and Ama's Momento from the framed photos in the Travel Room. Host a viewing party with up to three friends for a unique experience of complex family relationships and following dreams.\n\nHappy Mother's Day from Team Alcove!\n",
