I'm talking about 100 bowling balls with different weight and speed, and while some are admittedly unrealistic, most of these are setup exactly like real bowling balls where slight differences in the design change the physics of the ball. They also went above and beyond offering unique soundtracks for each of the 6 lanes with a lot of good music including some licenced stuff. \n\n So handling wise it's Wii Sports from my perspective, you can twist your wrist and give it some spin in the same way your just adding in the whole roomscale aspect of VR to the equation so in that regard I recommend giving yourself some space (though I've seen some play it seated so that could be an option for some in the right seat). But it all feels really good and I have been told from the devs that they had pro bowlers test this to ensure it felt realistic. There are special balls like gutter avoider which curves when it gets near a gutter, and stuff like the power shot that is almost like throwing a bullet but there is tons of stuff that look cool and might make some sounds but they are traditional bowling balls in how they perform on the lane. The game currently is teleport and snap turning only (you can change how much your snap turning in options) but they have assured us the first update will include smooth locomotion options.\n\n Multiplayer wise it supports 4 players online and 8 players locally with pass and play and if your using a game sharing thing with a family member this game supports that as well so you only need to buy one copy. There is a weekly leaderboard for each level and a local leaderboard but the scores will not intersect so if you get a 300 in weekly ranked its not going to show on local and vice versa. \n\n  To conclude I found this a fantastic Bowling VR game and had a great time playing it by myself and with friends. I highly recommend purchasing it if your into bowling or if your looking for the perfect game to play with a group of friends.",
