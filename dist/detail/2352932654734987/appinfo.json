							"body_text": "Update: The Hard Mode Citadel Raid Beta that was originally scheduled for the April 6th patch has been moved to April 27th to allow the Dev team time to tackle some recent server stability issues.\n\nApril 6th Patch\n\nOur next big patch is on the horizon! On April 6th, we will be releasing the following new content in-game:\n\nHighsteppe Area Farms\n\nThe citizens of Highsteppe have decided it's time to start expanding life beyond the walls of the city. In the next patch, you'll find a few small farms and one fishing hut dotting the hillsides of the Highsteppe zone. We're also bringing back the sheep from old Orbus to breathe a little life into the farms. While there won't be any new quests for the farms at launch, expect to see some in the future!\n\nBard Mechanic Fixes\n\nThis patch will also include some long-awaited fixes for broken instruments and mechanics for the Bard class. Once these fixes are live, we will give the community some time to play and gather new data on the Bard class for the upcoming balance pass.\n\nApril 27th Patch\n\nHard Mode Citadel Raid Beta\n\nNow that players have mastered each of the boss fights in the normal raid, it's time to launch the next set of harder mechanics. The beta will launch on April 27th, with the final version launching a week later on May 4th. This should give us enough time to work out any bugs, uncover any potential flaws in the fights, and make sure the balance is just the right amount of challenge.\n\nDuring the Beta, no armor, weapons, or rewards will drop, but once the official hard mode raid launches, you'll have a chance to earn gear and weapons, an exclusive cape, and an Enraged Sephotep pet!\n\nTank/Healer Balance Pass\n\nAfter the April 6th patch, we will begin working on the balance pass for the Tanks/Healers. We will be looking at things like aggro retention, healing numbers, damage, etc. We are not planning on doing any major mechanic or talent reworks, but hope to bring the classes to where we feel they need to be balance-wise.\n\nFuture Update: Community Tools\n\nAs the community continues to grow, we are looking at ways to make it easier to report and mute other players. We will also be adding an additional feature to \"block\" other players, which will turn them into a \"ghost\" (similar to when a player dies in game), mute them, and prevent all invitations (trade, party, personal messages, etc.).\n\nWe will also be working on more automated systems behind the scenes to identify toxic behavior so that we can continue to ensure that players have the best possible in-game experience, and that our community as a whole continues to be the helpful, passionate, and caring community that this game has become known for.",

							"body_text": "Spring has returned to Patreayl again and with it the spring festival of Skogronn.Two familiar foes have also made their return: the Skogtrolls, who can be spotted near the tree shrines maintained in their honor, and the ravens, who are known to steal offerings from the shrines on their migration through Patreayl.\n\nWhile some see the Skogtrolls as benevolent spirits vital to the recovery of Patreayl's natural resources, others see them as murderous, malevolent spirits. Visit the Festival NPC outside the gates of Highsteppe to pick up the first quest and decide for yourself!\n\n\n\nThis year’s rewards include:\n\n- Spring Festival 2021 Cape\n- Shrine Mount\n- Flower Transmog Helm and Shoulder Set\n\n\n\nDragon Breeding Update: New Colors\n\nToday’s patch also includes 3 new color additions to the dragon breeding pool:  Hot Pink, Yellow, and Taupe. With this addition, there are now a total of 13 colors available for dragon breeding—which means there are more than 2,000 different color combinations possible. From this patch forward, all new dragons bred will also have the name of the breeder saved inside the tooltip data that pops up when hovering over the item.\n\nNew Community Event Area\n\nToday’s patch will also include a new space for the community to hold events without performance issues associated with large-scale events in the overworld. It is called Edge of Nowhere and can be accessed through a door inside the Highsteppe Tavern next to the Long-Term Mission vendor.\n\nIt is a 1 SQ KM, sparsely decorated area with no monsters or other game play elements to keep performance as high as possible. We are hoping that this will be a good area for the larger community events that have been taking place in the overworld!",

							"reviewDescription": "This is the first and only available vr mmorpg right now, which makes it a must buy product.\nUnfortunately this is all about pros.\n\nCons:\n- The graphics is not good but still suitable.\n- Not newbies friendly.\n- Strange mechanics. Like every class has his own mini game to perform during the battle. Some of it even looks interesting, but exists in a stupid way. Like a mage here has to memorize and draw runes in the air which is challenging since it needs to be done without any mistake. It would be fun if after all the hard drawing you cast something really powerful that insta kills a mob or does a lot of area damage. But instead you do just regular dps and have to spam a \"B\" sign like an idiot. Which in the end of the day just makes you pick a Scoundrel (a class with a handgun) and do no brain spamming of shots.\n- Lack of diversity. As I said there is no regular classes here since the mechanics are pretty strange and annoying. The problem could be solved by adding a system of talents or specs. So you would have this rune mage, but also some classic fire or ice mage and can choose your own play style. Still there is no such system in a game.\n\nThe conclusion:\nThis is the first game of it's kind and would be a must buy and must play as long as there are no competitors nearby. But I'm afraid the first alternative that comes to the market (for example Ilysia) will kill it. Cause people want classic wow like game style and user friendly experience.\n\nAs for me, I enjoy it since there are no alternatives.",
