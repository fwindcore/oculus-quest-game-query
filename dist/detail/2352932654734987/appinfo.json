The patch features two new farms, one in each direction off Trader’s Road, and the return of sheep to the world of Orbus. Please be kind to our new four legged friends, as they die easily and are hard for the farmers to replace.\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to the new overworld farms, you’ll also find a new dock and fishing hut at the lake next to the Kingsport Graveyard.\n\n\n\nWe’ll be introducing some side quests featuring the farms in future updates.\n\nThis patch also includes some updates and fixes for the Bard class. (For a full list of fixes, please visit the Community Forums.) While some of the fixes for the Bard class were closer to a balance pass than true mechanic fixes, we wanted to get the class closer to its intended state before we start looking at the overall healer/tank/support balance pass. We will begin collecting data on all the classes for this upcoming balance pass in the coming weeks, and will work closely with the community as we did on the DPS balance pass.\n\n",

							"body_text": "Update: The Hard Mode Citadel Raid Beta that was originally scheduled for the April 6th patch has been moved to April 27th to allow the Dev team time to tackle some recent server stability issues.\n\nApril 6th Patch\n\nOur next big patch is on the horizon! On April 6th, we will be releasing the following new content in-game:\n\nHighsteppe Area Farms\n\nThe citizens of Highsteppe have decided it's time to start expanding life beyond the walls of the city. In the next patch, you'll find a few small farms and one fishing hut dotting the hillsides of the Highsteppe zone. We're also bringing back the sheep from old Orbus to breathe a little life into the farms. While there won't be any new quests for the farms at launch, expect to see some in the future!\n\nBard Mechanic Fixes\n\nThis patch will also include some long-awaited fixes for broken instruments and mechanics for the Bard class. Once these fixes are live, we will give the community some time to play and gather new data on the Bard class for the upcoming balance pass.\n\nApril 27th Patch\n\nHard Mode Citadel Raid Beta\n\nNow that players have mastered each of the boss fights in the normal raid, it's time to launch the next set of harder mechanics. The beta will launch on April 27th, with the final version launching a week later on May 4th. This should give us enough time to work out any bugs, uncover any potential flaws in the fights, and make sure the balance is just the right amount of challenge.\n\nDuring the Beta, no armor, weapons, or rewards will drop, but once the official hard mode raid launches, you'll have a chance to earn gear and weapons, an exclusive cape, and an Enraged Sephotep pet!\n\nTank/Healer Balance Pass\n\nAfter the April 6th patch, we will begin working on the balance pass for the Tanks/Healers. We will be looking at things like aggro retention, healing numbers, damage, etc. We are not planning on doing any major mechanic or talent reworks, but hope to bring the classes to where we feel they need to be balance-wise.\n\nFuture Update: Community Tools\n\nAs the community continues to grow, we are looking at ways to make it easier to report and mute other players. We will also be adding an additional feature to \"block\" other players, which will turn them into a \"ghost\" (similar to when a player dies in game), mute them, and prevent all invitations (trade, party, personal messages, etc.).\n\nWe will also be working on more automated systems behind the scenes to identify toxic behavior so that we can continue to ensure that players have the best possible in-game experience, and that our community as a whole continues to be the helpful, passionate, and caring community that this game has become known for.",

The biggest tip I can give,  is if you're stuck on the initial part,  just say out loud your new and looking for help or answers to questions near any group of players.  90% of the time someone  will stop and assist.",
