By month, we released:\n\n- February: Phase II of the Explorer’s League Outpost questline\n- March: Spring Festival\n- April: Secrets of Mugwood DLC, featuring four all-new zones, as well as a new storyline, NPCs and more\n- June: Summer Festival + Explore the Realm Event\n- September: Island Patch, featuring all-new island zone filled with elites and aberrations, a long-term mission vendor, bracers, overworld treasure hunt, new overleveling perks, and a host of new rewards game-wide\n- October: Fall Harvest Festival\n- December: Winter Festival of Strangers + Citadel Raid\n\nDecember 2020 also marks our third anniversary. The more the VR industry continues to grow, the more grateful we are for our community and that you all continue to come back to the game month in and month out. For your continued feedback and input, for helping us track down bugs (and for your patience in seeing them fixed), for helping us welcome all the new players to the game this year...we want to say thank you. An MMO is nothing without its community, and we continue to maintain that Orbus has the best community in VR.\n\nThe Dev team is already hard at work on some plans for next year. Keep an eye out for more info in early January about what's coming next. Here's to another year of OrbusVR!",

							"body_text": "The winter Festival of Strangers is back!\n\nBack in the days of old, when the nights were dark and long, the “Strangers” first descended. Bipedal beasts of great strength and size, they left their hillside caves at the first snow to wreak havoc on the villages of Patreayl. Isolated clans came together to beat the strange creatures back into the hills every year and afterward celebrate their victory. Thus, the Festival of Strangers was born.\n\n\n\nWe have officially switched the terrain over to the winter season and rolled out the festival. To pick up all the relevant mission and quests, you will need to visit:\n\n- Festival NPC outside the gates of Highsteppe - main Heart of the Strangers questline\n- Festival Farmer outside the Critter Capture shop - Floating lights side quest\n- Pierre Cenn inside the Critter Capture shop - Snowman Critter Capture mission\n\n\n\nThis year’s rewards include:\n\n- Snowman Transmog set\n- Fireplace (Player House furniture)\n- Snowshoes mount\n- Festival of Strangers 2020 cape\n- 2020 Snowman pet\n\nThe Furniture Shop in Highsteppe will also have several winter festival-themed items for sale again. The Snowman furniture blueprints will also be available again as a rare drop off the wild snowmen bouncing around the overworld.\n\nFor those who remember last year’s quests, you’ll know that completing the questline is much easier with friends, so don’t be a stranger in game and ask somebody if they want to play!",

							"reviewDescription": "I'll start by saying that I really do like this game. With that said, I think there are a few things worth getting out of the way so that you can make a good purchasing decision. This is not your normal run-of-the-mill MMO. If you're hoping for WOW in VR, then this isn't that. It is a great MMO that requires you to think, research, and coordinate with others. However, it doesn't hold your hand very much, and it requires you to learn from others and from content that you'll find online. The tutorial is very basic and doesn't cover everything. You'll need to reach out to other players so that you can learn about how to play the game and where to go. Expect that you'll need to watch videos and read guides in order to figure out what you need to do. This is not the sort of game that you can just jump into solo and then expect that everything will work out. With that out of the way, there is a lot to like about Orbus. It includes all of the staples that you'd expect from a full MMO:\n\n- Dungeons\n- Raids\n- Open-world Bosses\n- Open-world PVP\n- Battleground PVP\n- Player Housing\n- Progression\n- Loot collection\n- Crafting\n- Mounts\n\nI'd recommend this game to anyone that is ready to put in a little work to get the most out of it. However if you're only used to modern hold-your-hand MMO's or mobile MMO's, then this is not similar. You have to really explore and navigate to find your objectives. The classes are all skill-based and you'll need to learn to swing/shoot your weapon accurately. If you don't like to talk to other people, or if you don't speak English, then don't buy this game. Working and talking with others isn't really optional if you want to figure things out. It may feel like I'm being negative, but what I'm trying to do is to make sure that if you buy this, you do it with the right expectations and for the right reasons. If you are looking for a deep experience on your Quest, then this game has that in spades. It's an amazing game for the right kind of gamer.",
