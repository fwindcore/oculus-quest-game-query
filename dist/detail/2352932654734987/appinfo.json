Visit the Festival NPC outside the gates of Highsteppe to pick up the first quest and decide for yourself!\n\n\n\nThis year’s rewards include:\n\n- Spring Festival 2021 Cape\n- Shrine Mount\n- Flower Transmog Helm and Shoulder Set\n\n\n\nDragon Breeding Update: New Colors\n\nToday’s patch also includes 3 new color additions to the dragon breeding pool:  Hot Pink, Yellow, and Taupe. With this addition, there are now a total of 13 colors available for dragon breeding—which means there are more than 2,000 different color combinations possible. From this patch forward, all new dragons bred will also have the name of the breeder saved inside the tooltip data that pops up when hovering over the item.\n\nNew Community Event Area\n\nToday’s patch will also include a new space for the community to hold events without performance issues associated with large-scale events in the overworld. It is called Edge of Nowhere and can be accessed through a door inside the Highsteppe Tavern next to the Long-Term Mission vendor.\n\nIt is a 1 SQ KM, sparsely decorated area with no monsters or other game play elements to keep performance as high as possible. We are hoping that this will be a good area for the larger community events that have been taking place in the overworld!",

							"reviewDescription": "This is the first and only available vr mmorpg right now, which makes it a must buy product.\nUnfortunately this is all about pros.\n\nCons:\n- The graphics is not good but still suitable.\n- Not newbies friendly.\n- Strange mechanics. Like every class has his own mini game to perform during the battle. Some of it even looks interesting, but exists in a stupid way. Like a mage here has to memorize and draw runes in the air which is challenging since it needs to be done without any mistake. It would be fun if after all the hard drawing you cast something really powerful that insta kills a mob or does a lot of area damage. But instead you do just regular dps and have to spam a \"B\" sign like an idiot. Which in the end of the day just makes you pick a Scoundrel (a class with a handgun) and do no brain spamming of shots.\n- Lack of diversity. As I said there is no regular classes here since the mechanics are pretty strange and annoying. The problem could be solved by adding a system of talents or specs. So you would have this rune mage, but also some classic fire or ice mage and can choose your own play style. Still there is no such system in a game.\n\nThe conclusion:\nThis is the first game of it's kind and would be a must buy and must play as long as there are no competitors nearby. But I'm afraid the first alternative that comes to the market (for example Ilysia) will kill it. Cause people want classic wow like game style and user friendly experience.\n\nAs for me, I enjoy it since there are no alternatives.",
