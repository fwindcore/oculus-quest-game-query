Here’s a quick look at what you have to look forward to in the next couple months in Orbus.\n\n3-Year Anniversary Event\nOrbusVR is officially 3! To celebrate, we are doing an in-game scavenger hunt. The hunt will launch Tuesday, Feb. 2 and will run through Tuesday, March 2.\n\nWe’ll have a couple of giveaways, as well as a fun prize for completing the scavenger hunt. We’ll also be doing an in-game meet-up with the Devs Wednesday, Feb. 3 from 6 - 7 PM CST. More details to come next week!\n\nQuest 2 Improvements\nBeta testing for Quest 2 updates is complete and will roll out to the entire community in the next patch. With this change, Quest 2 users will now be able to see toolbelt items and mounts on other players. You can also say goodbye to two left hands as other players should now display with both a left and a right hand. A big thank you to those members of the community who helped us with beta testing these changes!\n\nSpring Festival\nThe spring festival will be returning to game on Tuesday, March 2—so if you’re getting tired of winter terrain, know that greener pastures are on the horizon! As always, we’ll have a few new rewards to hand out.\n\nHard Mode Citadel Raid\nToward the end of February/beginning of March we plan on releasing the hard mode version of the Citadel Raid, which will feature more challenging versions of the current raid’s boss fights, as well as new rewards.\n\nBug Fixes and Quality of Life Improvements\nThis year we are doubling down on looking into some of the top-reported bugs. With the Anniversary patch in a week and a half, we'll be implementing a couple of new changes, including:\n\n- a new, safer way to delete characters to help reduce chances of any accidental character deletions\n- a new lock button for your inventory that allows you to lock items in your inventory. With this new feature you won't be able to break down that item unless you manually unlock it\n- a check for new Fellowship members that first ensures they aren't already a member of another Fellowship\n- a fix for the Scoundrel deck relocation anchor getting rest when zoning\n\nLook for another post in the coming weeks with more details on the next patch!",

							"body_text": "Before we wrap up 2020 and look toward a new year, we wanted to take a moment to look back on how much happened in Orbus in the last year. 2020 definitely wasn’t the year that anyone was expecting, but in the world of OrbusVR, it was a pretty busy year! By month, we released:\n\n- February: Phase II of the Explorer’s League Outpost questline\n- March: Spring Festival\n- April: Secrets of Mugwood DLC, featuring four all-new zones, as well as a new storyline, NPCs and more\n- June: Summer Festival + Explore the Realm Event\n- September: Island Patch, featuring all-new island zone filled with elites and aberrations, a long-term mission vendor, bracers, overworld treasure hunt, new overleveling perks, and a host of new rewards game-wide\n- October: Fall Harvest Festival\n- December: Winter Festival of Strangers + Citadel Raid\n\nDecember 2020 also marks our third anniversary. The more the VR industry continues to grow, the more grateful we are for our community and that you all continue to come back to the game month in and month out. For your continued feedback and input, for helping us track down bugs (and for your patience in seeing them fixed), for helping us welcome all the new players to the game this year...we want to say thank you. An MMO is nothing without its community, and we continue to maintain that Orbus has the best community in VR.\n\nThe Dev team is already hard at work on some plans for next year. Keep an eye out for more info in early January about what's coming next. Here's to another year of OrbusVR!",

							"reviewDescription": "I'll start by saying that I really do like this game. With that said, I think there are a few things worth getting out of the way so that you can make a good purchasing decision. This is not your normal run-of-the-mill MMO. If you're hoping for WOW in VR, then this isn't that. It is a great MMO that requires you to think, research, and coordinate with others. However, it doesn't hold your hand very much, and it requires you to learn from others and from content that you'll find online. The tutorial is very basic and doesn't cover everything. You'll need to reach out to other players so that you can learn about how to play the game and where to go. Expect that you'll need to watch videos and read guides in order to figure out what you need to do. This is not the sort of game that you can just jump into solo and then expect that everything will work out. With that out of the way, there is a lot to like about Orbus. It includes all of the staples that you'd expect from a full MMO:\n\n- Dungeons\n- Raids\n- Open-world Bosses\n- Open-world PVP\n- Battleground PVP\n- Player Housing\n- Progression\n- Loot collection\n- Crafting\n- Mounts\n\nI'd recommend this game to anyone that is ready to put in a little work to get the most out of it. However if you're only used to modern hold-your-hand MMO's or mobile MMO's, then this is not similar. You have to really explore and navigate to find your objectives. The classes are all skill-based and you'll need to learn to swing/shoot your weapon accurately. If you don't like to talk to other people, or if you don't speak English, then don't buy this game. Working and talking with others isn't really optional if you want to figure things out. It may feel like I'm being negative, but what I'm trying to do is to make sure that if you buy this, you do it with the right expectations and for the right reasons. If you are looking for a deep experience on your Quest, then this game has that in spades. It's an amazing game for the right kind of gamer.",
