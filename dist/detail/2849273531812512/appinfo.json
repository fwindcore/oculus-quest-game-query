							"reviewDescription": "The keyboard overlay is MAGIC, and I love being able to spawn up to five (!) virtual monitors from my laptop. While I'm sure Immersed is great for collaborative work, I use it for my daily writing. Not only does it give me an easy way to write in environments (virtual coffee shop, floating space station, productivity cave with a waterfall, a glass house, above the clouds etc) other than my cluttered small basement office, but I find it far easier to focus on my work without the distractions of my real-life workspace.\n\nI'm new to VR --have only had my Oculus Quest 2 a few weeks-- and am blown away by how immersed (ha!) I feel in the various environments; it's a welcome change after many months of being homebound during the pandemic. Once I start traveling again, I look forward to taking this virtual workspace with me on trips via my MacBook Air and Oculus Quest 2.\n\nI've had a number of fellow freelancers ask me how difficult it is to read the virtual screens. One thing I love is that you can make your virtual screen(s) as large as you want! For me, this makes the screen much easier to read than the tiny one on my ancient MacBook Air. And of course you can enlarge the type on whatever writing software you're using. I tend to only use 1-2 screens; I use one as my main writing screen, and the other for reference notes. \n\nI tried out the free trial version and upgraded to the Elite. One of the factors that nudged me into wanting to upgrade: the very active and helpful Discord community - I know I can get help when I need it. The developers are enthusiastic and friendly, always open to feedback and suggestions. The updates are regular and continue to improve. I can't wait to see what the upcoming \"focusmode\" and \"customizable workspaces\" are like!",
