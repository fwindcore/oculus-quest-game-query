You’ll have the full week to master the competition and earn a top spot on the leaderboard. You can work your way up the ranks of REAKT training status as you continue to participate in weekly challenges and earn trophies based on your weekly challenge leaderboard spot!\n\nOne Handed Training\nAll athletes can benefit from strengthening non-dominant hand coordination. Studies have shown that actively using your non-dominant hand can balance out your body and activate and build more connections in your brain. We’ve now added options for you to focus your training on your dominant or non-dominant hands in Athletic Awareness training.\n\nMiscellaneous\n- Season 2 Competition Scoring Update: Clicking on a ball will now end your multiplier streak (in addition to slowing the ball down)\n- New Music! Each week’s challenge will have a new set of songs to bring out your inner competitor\n- New Recommended Trainings: Dominant and non-dominant hand training sessions  have been incorporated into new Recommended Trainings\n- Smoother launcher movement\n- General bug fixes",

Hopefully some expansion will take this to the next level.  Could be visually cooler.  It looks good, just not particularly exciting.   Two \"technical\" issues:\n1) Very light trigger can cause misfire when blocking very fast.  Very frustrating.  Would like to see ability to choose different controller button like x/a.  This might make it function better because it seems to misfire when throwing hands out very quickly to block. Oculus Quest 2 doesn't offer any trigger sensitivity adjustment in settings but adding that might be the best fix.\n2) Blocking circles are often too close, like a couple inches in front, and off to sides which makes them difficult to see at all.  Would like to see these a little further out or perhaps adjustable.",
