With our new update, you will be able to choose your own ball color, with more contrast between balls and bombs. This gives anyone who has challenges with color sensitivity a level playing field  when training their mind.\n\nHow to get it:\nThe next time you start your REAKT training, you’ll be prompted for your color preferences. You'll also always be able to change those preferences within the Settings menu.\n\nWe've been thrilled with the response to REAKT Performance Trainer in helping competitors improve reaction time and coordination. Whether you're a college athlete, a competitive VR gamer, or just wanting to train your mind to improve your overall brain health, everyone can benefit from regular training with REAKT. We read every single review, and are excited to see the different applications of VR brain training from our members.\n\nDrop us a line on Instagram and let us know why you train - we love hearing your stories.\n\nOr better yet - if you haven't already, leave us a review!\n\nStay tuned for more updates coming soon from the frontier of VR brain training....\n\nAnd until then, #REAKTFaster!\n\nThe REAKT Team\n",

A vital need, I'd say.\n2) some more explanations on the very detailed figures of your performance\n3) some comparisons to average and range of performances for your age/sex\nOverall, a unique and useful app. Good effort.",
