You’ll have the full week to master the competition and earn a top spot on the leaderboard. You can work your way up the ranks of REAKT training status as you continue to participate in weekly challenges and earn trophies based on your weekly challenge leaderboard spot!\n\nOne Handed Training\nAll athletes can benefit from strengthening non-dominant hand coordination. Studies have shown that actively using your non-dominant hand can balance out your body and activate and build more connections in your brain. We’ve now added options for you to focus your training on your dominant or non-dominant hands in Athletic Awareness training.\n\nMiscellaneous\n- Season 2 Competition Scoring Update: Clicking on a ball will now end your multiplier streak (in addition to slowing the ball down)\n- New Music! Each week’s challenge will have a new set of songs to bring out your inner competitor\n- New Recommended Trainings: Dominant and non-dominant hand training sessions  have been incorporated into new Recommended Trainings\n- Smoother launcher movement\n- General bug fixes",

With our new update, you will be able to choose your own ball color, with more contrast between balls and bombs. This gives anyone who has challenges with color sensitivity a level playing field  when training their mind.\n\nHow to get it:\nThe next time you start your REAKT training, you’ll be prompted for your color preferences. You'll also always be able to change those preferences within the Settings menu.\n\nWe've been thrilled with the response to REAKT Performance Trainer in helping competitors improve reaction time and coordination. Whether you're a college athlete, a competitive VR gamer, or just wanting to train your mind to improve your overall brain health, everyone can benefit from regular training with REAKT. We read every single review, and are excited to see the different applications of VR brain training from our members.\n\nDrop us a line on Instagram and let us know why you train - we love hearing your stories.\n\nOr better yet - if you haven't already, leave us a review!\n\nStay tuned for more updates coming soon from the frontier of VR brain training....\n\nAnd until then, #REAKTFaster!\n\nThe REAKT Team\n",

Hopefully some expansion will take this to the next level.  Could be visually cooler.  It looks good, just not particularly exciting.   Two \"technical\" issues:\n1) Very light trigger can cause misfire when blocking very fast.  Very frustrating.  Would like to see ability to choose different controller button like x/a.  This might make it function better because it seems to misfire when throwing hands out very quickly to block. Oculus Quest 2 doesn't offer any trigger sensitivity adjustment in settings but adding that might be the best fix.\n2) Blocking circles are often too close, like a couple inches in front, and off to sides which makes them difficult to see at all.  Would like to see these a little further out or perhaps adjustable.",
