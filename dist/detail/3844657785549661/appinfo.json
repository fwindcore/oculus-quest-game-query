With our new update, you will be able to choose your own ball color, with more contrast between balls and bombs. This gives anyone who has challenges with color sensitivity a level playing field  when training their mind.\n\nHow to get it:\nThe next time you start your REAKT training, you’ll be prompted for your color preferences. You'll also always be able to change those preferences within the Settings menu.\n\nWe've been thrilled with the response to REAKT Performance Trainer in helping competitors improve reaction time and coordination. Whether you're a college athlete, a competitive VR gamer, or just wanting to train your mind to improve your overall brain health, everyone can benefit from regular training with REAKT. We read every single review, and are excited to see the different applications of VR brain training from our members.\n\nDrop us a line on Instagram and let us know why you train - we love hearing your stories.\n\nOr better yet - if you haven't already, leave us a review!\n\nStay tuned for more updates coming soon from the frontier of VR brain training....\n\nAnd until then, #REAKTFaster!\n\nThe REAKT Team\n",

							"reviewDescription": "I've only played this for less than a week so I can't exactly tell if I'm getting better. I wish there was a better explanation about my reaction and accuracy between my right and left side. I haven't figured out the graph yet. \nAlso I'm missing a chart with my personal improvements. Instead of a score card where it shows that I'm at spot 1385 I'd rather see a personalized score card. I'd love to see how I'm doing from one to the next day. \nOverall it's a fun game but I find it very hard. Once in competition mode you have to hit the yellow targets with accuracy but as time goes by, they come at you quicker and you can't wait for the targets to hit, you have to go by intuition otherwise you miss the bombs coming at you. If you don't hit the targets just right the game stops. That's where I wish it would keep going and at the end of the 2 minutes give you the score of how many missed and how many you hit with accuracy. \nI'm sure I will improve with time even-though right now I feel defeated. \n\nThe last thing that I find difficult, is the peripheral vision in VR. You're supposed to look straight ahead, at least that's how I understood it, but you're automatically trying to look where to hit the target, and if it's to the right or all the way to the left and and bomb comes from the opposite end corner, there's no way I even see that one coming. Even just turning your head slightly to one side obscures the other end. At least, that is what I found. \nI'm giving it 4 stars because I feel with just a few tiny improvements this could become a great addition to any athlete. Thank you REAKT!",

One thing to note is that when you move your cursor over your \"1385\" spot we will show you how you have done in the (3) key areas we measure. It will display your longest streak, the bombs you have tracked, and how many perfect catches you have made. You can view the leader's 3 key metrics too and see how you compare to them. We would recommend training in the Visual Concentration mode to improve your peripheral vision. Start with 2 targets and work your way up over time to improve your peripheral vision. We look forward to seeing you climb that leaderboard!",
