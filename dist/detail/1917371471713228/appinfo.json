							"reviewDescription": "I've recently got this game, because it's made by the creators of virtual virtual reality, so what could be bad about it? The answer...\n\nNothing(was that a good build up?ü§´)\n\nBut I am yet to buy the full game, so I've only seen the demo. And what a demo it was. It's not gotten boring once, and I've replayed it 12 times! So no recommendations here, just telling you and others about my expirience so far. But I'm definitely getting the timeboat and multiplayer. That's also why I got the game. I'm less of a chatty person, and prefer things like beat saber multiplayer, or a rec room junior account(even though rec room doesent work). I dont like using voice chat. But this game hooked me. No voice chat, real actors, magic mask...  it was the perfect game for me. So I'm gonna edit this review when I buy the multiplayer and timeboat, but thank you for reading it anyway üòÅ\n\n\n\nEdit:\nI'm so happy I got this add on. As soon as I joined I was greeted to someone watching a show, and he was really kind. Also, this one guy was teaching me how to change my hat. Then someone made a finger that I then ate. Overall best community ever, not boring at all and great map. It's a must play/must buy. And the spells are so cool. I liked figuring them out as I played. And the people in the jars in the demo show up in the theatre. Plus how do you change the symbols on your mask? So overall get the add on, it's worth it, and it will change the demo at some point.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBYE THIS GAME NOW\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBYE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBYE",
