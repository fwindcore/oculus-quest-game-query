I’m a long time southerner, growing up on the lake fishing and that was the biggest thing I lost with my disability, the ability to reel. I’d still go sit in the boat for a good time, but couldn’t handle the fight. \n\nAnd this game fixed it all. Now, with the pandemic, I can go fish with my nephews and nieces and just hang out, and I get to enjoy the fight when I do catch one. Thank you for the consideration to make this an inclusive game. Sometimes, we just sit in the lodge and chat with a cold one. Only downside is a room is limited to 4. \n\nMy gosh, it’s beautiful and realistic. It’s only South Korea right now, and I hope they expand it to new waterways. I’ll gladly buy any dlc that comes along. \n\nNow if you could just come up with a way to let me ignore it when folks tell me to put it down, it’s time for bed. Thanks. Can’t wait for the first expansion.",

Miragesoft as a company has always wanted to help people heal in our game, be it with meeting new and old friends, being with family, and relaxing in peaceful environments.  \n\nWe would love to increase the room limit, however, due to limited computing power, it is hard to implement it in our game. \nWe are currently in the development of the United States DLC. The release date is not certain, but we think it should be out before the end of the year. \n\nWe will keep working hard to provide you with the best quality gaming experience. Thank you again for loving our game!",
