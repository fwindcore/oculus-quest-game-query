I picked this game up on the Black Friday sale and it‚Äôs blown me away. The graphics and sound are incredible (as others have mentioned)! You are placed in an almost google earth looking type view of scenery with varying weather and time setting (including things like spontaneous fireworks, active weather, and other little bonuses). \n\nThe fish are incredibly realistic looking and the actual fishing provides some challenge for those looking for it. I love sipping my drink, enjoying the ambiance, and reeling in some fish. I‚Äôve already almost reached max level but what keeps me coming back is the tranquility of the game and being able to play with friends! \n\nI‚Äôve made fishing and listening to lo-fi music (there is an in game browser you can watch things or play music through) with my buddy an almost nightly occurrence. Heck, we don‚Äôt even fish the whole time while instead enjoying chatting in all the serene views or hanging out in the lodge. \n\nYou can really tell the devs put in a ton of work into this game and it honestly puts me into another level of immersion. I‚Äôd love to see more locations (20 spots in Beautiful Korea included) and maybe the ability to fish in any direction 360 if you‚Äôre on a boat. But even without that this game is 5 stars. Whether you like fishing or not there‚Äôs so much joy to be had with this game I highly recommend it.",

Our team has indeed brought in lots of effort to create the immersive environment in the game. We will be adding more locations as DLC; however, it's getting delayed due to COVID-19. Instead, we are going to have more fish species and items for the coming update. And also our team will see if the 360 direction fishing is feasible for a future update. Thank you for your support and happy fishing.",
