These additions change Arcade enough for us to have had to reset the leaderboards. Apologies. We do hope you find these new changes worth it, though!\n\nThank you all for sticking with us as we continue to develop and expand RNX!",

An hour later I was dripping with sweat and had to force myself to stop (this hobby doesn't pay for itself!)\n\nThis takes tennis/table tennis/racquetball (whatever you're looking for) not just to the next level, but the next plane of existence. The lights, the sounds, the admiring awe in the announcer's voice (\"DAYUUUUUUM\"), I was immediately hooked. \n\nThen. Then I added my own music. Hitting a killer streak while your favorite song throbs in the background elevates this to a spiritual experience. \n\nThank god you can swap hands, because the first night I played so much I could barely move my arm the next day, and I didn't want to take a day off. I will become ambidextrous for this game. \n\nMy only suggestions for improvement would be more variety in the Zen visualizations, and in the same vein something more exciting when you clear a level, because successfully beating it and failing it look the same. Other than that, amazing work, devs!",
