These additions change Arcade enough for us to have had to reset the leaderboards. Apologies. We do hope you find these new changes worth it, though!\n\nThank you all for sticking with us as we continue to develop and expand RNX!",

So much fun, and keeps me coming back for more to see if I can beat my last score.\n\nOne thing I would change is the option to change the music during the game. It's so annoying when there's a tune playing that I like and it changes when I long press the trigger button. Please change the button to do this to a button less used during the game.\n\nUpdate: The makers have added a Power-up mushroom to the game and it shoots you up making you taller and shoots you back down after a little while. My body did not enjoy this update, moments later I had a headache and had to stop playing. Thought maybe it was a one off, so the next day (today) I played again and yet again I got the mushroom (by mistake as I was trying to avoid it) and yet again another headache!!!\n\nThere are some great new levels so it's not all bad, but it's annoying I have to avoid the mushroom for now on to avoid a headaches which is something I thought I'd never say \n\nGone from a 5/5 game to a 4.5/5 game.",
