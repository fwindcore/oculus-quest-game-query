							"body_text": "We’ve been thrilled by the phenomenal response to our hand-tracking update on Oculus Quest last month. Today we are happy to reveal EVEN MORE features and improvements for Quest in our Lightning update, available right now! This time around we are introducing Slingshot fingers that lets you fire projectiles, lightning hands with the power to electrocute everything, new accessibility mode for those with missing fingers, a new easter egg (good luck!) and multiple improvements to existing features, including gesture recognition.\n\nWe believe VR is a medium that has potential to make computing more accessible than any medium to date. It has always been important to us to make virtual reality accessible to as many people as possible. For example, from the very start Waltz was—and still is—one of the few VR games designed to work using only one hand.\n\nWhen we released the initial hand-tracking update in May we received a request from a user who had issues with Quest’s hand-tracking due to missing fingers, leading to that user experiencing uncomfortable sensations. We’re happy to release this new feature to let users improve their experience by making virtual representations of missing fingers move in sync with other fingers, instead of randomly moving due to non-existant tracking data.\n\nWe greatly value feedback and discussions on all Waltz and VR related things and anyone is always welcome to join our Discord! (https://discord.gg/cxHB5zF)\n\nWe have big plans for Waltz of the Wizard this year that we are very excited about. While we can’t share details just yet, let’s just say we are opening new doors for the future of Waltz of the Wizard — with our strong focus on VR design innovation, as always.\n\nFull blog post available here: https://medium.com/aldin-dynamics/lightning-update-waltz-of-the-wizard-on-oculus-quest-45b0ad5a7ab",

I got a $30 game and was soooo disappointed.   I got a refund back and found this game for $10 and decided to try it out.   I can easily say it was better than the $30 game and most of the other games on the quest, especially for its price.   This game has so much to do from mini games to potions to spells and exploring the magical room you’re in.   But there’s way more!   And recently I’ve discovered that there’s gonna be a content update that’s decently sized to even kinda big from what I can’t tell and I’m still in shock that this amazing game was $10.\n\n✋👁👄👁️ 👌\n      🦵          🦵",
