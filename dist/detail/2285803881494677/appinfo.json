							"reviewDescription": "I bought this in a whim thinking it looks kind of fun, and really like it more than expected. For me, when I'm short on time, I like that each range session or moment of game play is a short stint so that I can quickly shoot around and then get back to real life. Because of this I probably have played this game more than anything other. I keep getting drawn to it. It's very active target practice and just fun.\n\n It's not too hard to level up and it's a good challenge too. The level of difficulty can change depending on your gun of choice for that level and how upgraded your weapon is (easier with upgraded guns and ammo). At first it's a bit difficult to manually do things with your gun like reload or click on things but you get used to it with your hands physically being in controllers doing what hands do virtually. \n\nUse the \"sandbox\" to plan out what guns you wish to buy and modification you would upgrade on you gun. Then when you earn money get those items strategically you really want because once you buy a gun or parts you can not sell it back that I know of.",
