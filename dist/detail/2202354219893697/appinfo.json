Fight your way through waves of responsive targets, samurai, and highly dangerous ninjas - all while drawing, nocking, and shooting your arrows as quickly as possible. \n\nHolopoint is a skill based game where progression is based on player skill and training rather than unlocks. Like many arcade style games, personal progress and a high score is the goal. This game quickly becomes difficult and requires an active mindset. Holopoint is designed so that only a few determined archers will reach the last wave.\n\nWARNING: THIS GAME GETS INTENSE. REMEMBER TO BREATH AND TAKE BREAKS.",

							"reviewDescription": "Holopoint was on my radar even before I had an Oculus, it looked like a game that was simultaneously fun and active. I’m happy to report that I was not disappointed. The freedom of no cords with the Oculus makes this a must-buy if you’re into active games. Another reviewer had it right in that the sensation of drawing your bow and firing arrows at multiple enemies, all while dodging their attacks, reminds me of the Hunger Games training center. Wave after wave compels you to keep fighting and to learn from your mistakes for the next round. The graphics are simple but clean and fluid. This game is best played with headphones to really use the directional audio cues. The only wish that I have is that the game should not require an internet connection in order to play. I wrote to the company and they told me the internet is used for high scores and saves, but that they would consider an offline option in the future. I’d currently rate the game at 4 1/2 stars, but if they offer an offline version, 5 stars all the way. This game is absolutely worth the price, be sure and check it out!",
