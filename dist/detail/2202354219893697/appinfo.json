Like many arcade style games, personal progress and a high score is the goal. This game quickly becomes difficult and requires an active mindset.

							"reviewDescription": "If you like VR archery but you also want some exercise, then this is definitely the game for you. You're almost constantly in motion, ducking, dodging, and twisting to avoid a onslaught of of targets. It's a lot of fun, but exhausting. I started two weeks ago and could only manage about 30 minutes, now I'm up to an hour and on wave 28/30... it's pretty addictive, albeit very simple gameplay. It's more about speed than anything else. If you're looking for something about accuracy or range, this is probably not the game for you : speed and body movement are everything. I would say it's definitely exercise-oriented. \n\nThough simple, the variety and randomisation of targets is sufficient to keep it interesting. The level difficulty is slightly non-linear, which keeps the feeling of progress and stops you getting exhausted too quickly. There's not much in the way of instruction, which occasionally makes things confusing, but things are generally simple enough to learn that you can figure it out for yourself. My biggest frustration was finding the sweet spot for loading the arrow, but once you've got that, things become a great deal easier.\n\nThere's definite scope for improvement here, especially at the price. It could easily be made a lot prettier without impacting performance. More, much stronger haptic feedback would help (seriously, the bow-drawing haptic in Elven Assassin is perfect, why hasn't anyone else imitated that ?), especially to tell if you've drawn an arrow and if you've been hit. Better sound to give more cues as to where the targets are would also help, as would having a variety of music.\n\nAll in all it's very solid if you're sick of sitting around like a couch potato all day, but somewhat limited if you're more interested in gameplay.",
