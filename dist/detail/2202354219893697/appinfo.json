Fight your way through waves of responsive targets, samurai, and highly dangerous ninjas - all while drawing, nocking, and shooting your arrows as quickly as possible. \n\nHolopoint is a skill based game where progression is based on player skill and training rather than unlocks. Like many arcade style games, personal progress and a high score is the goal. This game quickly becomes difficult and requires an active mindset. Holopoint is designed so that only a few determined archers will reach the last wave.\n\nWARNING: THIS GAME GETS INTENSE. REMEMBER TO BREATH AND TAKE BREAKS.",

The new visuals have much more detail but retain the simple and clean Holopoint look.\n• A new location, the Garden, has been opened and features thirty new waves as well as new targets. The Garden offers its own leaderboard to progress and focuses on more intense movements such as squatting.\n• Updated high contrast health display boards are easier to see and offer more clarity. When the player takes a hit the high contrast health boards slide to reveal a bright red color, warning the player that they have been hit.\n• New tatami mats help center the player in the play-space.\n• Cube holograms have been refreshed for an improved look \n• The main menu has been updated with game mode and location selection buttons.\n• A new Auto Quiver option allows players to automatically draw arrows without the use of the quiver. In practice this option does not offer much of a score advantage if any but does allow players to opt-out of the quiver requirement and greatly helps those who find this movement difficult.\n• The quiver has been adjusted to avoid unintentional arrow draws while still maintaining accurate arrow drawing when moving. The quiver now requires more precise movement of the hand to the side of the head to draw an arrow.\n• A new Floating Score Announcements option reveals point values in the air where targets are defeated. Orange values are shown when full points are awarded for a target, and blue values are shown when less points are awarded. No score value is shown if no score was awarded.\n• Improved high-speed arrow physics allows for more accurate collision detection in rare cases where targets may have previously not been detected.\n• A new audio manager plays different music tracks depending on current game state (idle vs in-game tracks).\n• Many bug fixes are also included for an overall better experience.",

							"reviewDescription": "Most apps offer more sounds and colours - few will give you an equally intense and satisfying workout for body and mind. The distraction-free setting may look unassuming; but it enhances concentration, performance and, ultimately, fun. The game is much more complex and varied than the first levels - and even the trailer - suggest. While now I‘m hooked, getting into it wasn‘t easy. For this reason two tipps for beginners:\n1) Don‘t start with the levels, but practise by shooting arrows around in the dojo. Mastering ancient wooden bows and arrows takes some time.\n2) Go to the devs website where you can download a guidebook with useful advice (which would better be included in the app).",
