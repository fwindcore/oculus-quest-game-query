							"reviewDescription": "5 stars because what the game does, it does quite well. And it deserves 5 stars . However, I've had this game for months and don't see myself playing it very often at all. \n\nI went on yesterday to try out there new Battle Bots, which is very similiar to what they had available for offline play during beta testing for solo practice . It's ok I guess . It gives people a chance to practice on their own, without dealing with possibly annoying players.  But can still be overwhelming, since it's basically a Rambo style practice game , or a horde mode game of you vs a team of 20 AI that will quickly swarm you. \n\nThe meat of the game is what I don't especially enjoy . Finding two other players that I enjoy playing with is not easy, and I don't enjoy randomly being matched up with strangers. Some of whom are very nice and helpful, but a lot are childish and rude. \n\nIf this ever becomes a team game of two players, or offers a solo mode, I believe I will enjoy this game a lot and be playing a lot more . But until then, it's just kinda there, sitting in my library collecting 'dust'.  I look at it every single day and consider hitting play, but more often then not, I pass and move onto another game.  \n\nThey have a great team of developers tho, and they did a fantastic job bringing their dreams to life . They deserve the hype and built a solid game.",
