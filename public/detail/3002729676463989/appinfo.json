Rewatch the best action from ONE: BIG BANG and ONE: BIG BANG II events recently held in Singapore.\n\nONE: BIG BANG - 4 DEC 2020\n\nIn the main event, three-time Kickboxing World Champion Marat Grigorian aims to show the world why he’s known as one of the greatest strikers in the world today, but it won’t be easy against a tough Russian like for Ivan Kondratev. The co-main event is a fight for a position at the top of the featherweight division, with #3-ranked Koyomi Matsushima taking on #5 contender and undefeated grappling expert Garry Tonon from the USA. It’s a classic battle between knockout artist and submission wizard, who will win this time?\n\nONE: BIG BANG II - 11 DEC 2020\n\nONE: BIG BANG II is headlined by two explosive striking matchups. In the main event, former ONE Flyweight Muay Thai World Champion Jonathan Haggerty from the UK defends his #3 ranking against surging Japanese superstar Taiki Naito, while kickboxing legend Nieky Holzken of the Netherlands battles to keep his #1 contender spot against Elliot Compton from Australia.",

But the most annoying thing is people jumping at you the moment that you step into the lobby. Solo mode should be the default mode as soon as you go in. My last time in I had someone get right in my face as soon as I got in and kept moving in front of me no matter which way I turned to get out of the way. I want the ability to walk around and choose a show to watch without having to constantly brush people off. The mechanism for going into Solo mode is too clunky and requires too many steps. \n\nWhen I get into a show, I want to WATCH the show and NOT have someone keep getting in my face trying to get my attention or trying to spark a conversation. PLEASE make Solo mode default. If I want to have a conversation with someone, I would rather that be an option and not the rule.",
