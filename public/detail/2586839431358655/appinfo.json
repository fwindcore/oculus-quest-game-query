It's clearly outlined throughout nthr store page. It's also free so please tuck tail and just uninstall it. We don't need a public display of your stupidity while also baslessly lowering the review score on such a unique and polished app. \n\nI love Tested and I've loved Adam Savage since the Mythbuster days. This app is fantastic. The presentation is excellent and the video quality is some of the best 3d Stereo out right now. Period. I've always wanted to see Adam's shop in VR. I was just talking to someone about watching an Untitled podcast episode or a one day buil in VR and this comes out of nowhere. It's above and beyond what I wanted. There's so much to see. His shop is the perfect place for 3D video. There's so much to see and so many layers to his stuff that it gives off some of the best depth and I swear my eyes were playing tricks. I could sense the parallax in some shots. \n\nThe video files are really large, however, they download in a few minutes. It's all very impressive. \n\nThis should be in everyone's library even if you don't know what tested is. This is a glimpse into the future of how we can get involved in our favorite creator's lives. We can be there with them, work along side them. It's an intimacy like never before. It's exciting stuff.",
