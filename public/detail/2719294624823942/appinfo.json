							"reviewDescription": "Update: Patch 1.3 is out and it doesn't have a journaling system even though every single review here said the game is unplayable without it. Instead Cyan concentrated on localization. KNOW YOUR CUSTOMERS!  Where are your priorities Cyan?\n---\nAs far as worthy games, Myst is probably in the top 10 of all Quest games. That's against stiff competition including Walking Dead: Saints & Sinners and The Room VR. The environments and artistry are genuinely breathtaking, there's some excellent world building, and the puzzles are challenging yet solvable if you are observant and think about the clues, especially those found in the library.  This type of gameplay might not be for everybody but it's the reason I bought my Quest. \n\nMyst island is a visual and aural feast. (I'm holding off exploring other locations until the next patch.) Most textures, like the brick work and floor tiles, are crisp and look so shiny you want to eat a meal off them. There's a few muddy textures here and there but it doesn't ruin the experience. The water looks so inviting I want to jump in. The clouds in the sky are pretty cool the way they move and distort. And that music!\n\nSome of the other reviews here state that Myst was making them sick. I brushed this off at first because I'm able to play Walking Dead for hours with no ill effects, and that includes lots of running and turning. But within minutes of my first Myst playthrough I noticed I didn't feel good. Other games with free locomotion sometimes have a VR sickness option via the \"tunnel\" effect, where your peripheral vision is cut down while moving. I hope the devs consider incorporating this option as it doesn't look too hard to implement in the Unreal engine.\n\nI won't belabor the lack of note taking since Cyan has stated it is on the way. Can't wait to see it! This game is 4 stars at the moment but could become 5 stars if they deal with a few key issues that would elevate it.",
