Extra immersion, with all the puzzles intact. This game doesn't hold your hand, but I encourage all puzzles lovers to try this out. Even if Myst isn't nostalgic. \n\nBe warned. You still have to take notes until Cyan updates a note taking feature in the game. I don't mind but some may be bothered by this. Still immersive and a wonderful world to explore.",
