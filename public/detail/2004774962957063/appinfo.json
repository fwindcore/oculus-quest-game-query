And if you look carefully, there might even be some sandwich recipes for you to discover\nOculus Quest 2 improvements: We’ve added better graphics, refresh rate and assets for the new headset.\n\nAdditional bug fixes and updates have also been made to  the game.\n\nWe hope you enjoy the new updates.
