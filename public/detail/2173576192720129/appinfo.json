							"reviewDescription": "Pros:\n- Awsom creativity ! Please keep it up \n- Astonishing VR 3D Space and planettes. Please make more like these! Especially when they are moving/orbiting slowly with casted shadows. \n- The narrative text is mindfully written and every day talks about a different psycological or personal development topic. I like the variety !\n- There are two types of approaches, calm and a kind of exercice. \n- VR 3D vidéos: my total respect to mr. Zimmmerman, Waw! Are they more?\n- Everyday, There is a brand new scène that we discover.\n- Updates : we can revisit previous mediations.\n\nCons: \n- Even if there is a remarkable improvment in terms of customising the today's tripp (A big Thank you), the customisation is still limited by eliminating trully free choices to what is listed only. So I won't call it 100% free customisation, since there is no AI involved, and it's basically picking up an old meditation 3d videos mixed with an audio file.\n- Customer service doesn't respond to new ideas emails or suggestions. I've sent 3 emails to them, no response. I still have a complete respect to the Tripp team for what they are bringing to the world, but there is always room for improvment, and customer service no matter what, should be a top priority.\n- There is 1 single female voice and 1 single male voice. Personally, with time, after using the app for months, I feel I need to hear different voices than the 2 only that are listed. I don't like them both and it prevents me even to focuse on the meditation itself.\nI've sent multiple times requests of providing more voices choices but nothing has changed on that regards. \n- Some vidéos have long fast-flashing scenes that seriousely mug our eyes, our brain and I am really surprised how they are included in such nice meditation app. Please remove them! They hurt our eyes !",
