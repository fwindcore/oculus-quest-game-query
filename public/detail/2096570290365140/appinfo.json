Things such as removing rag dolls on NPCs and reducing both sound and visual effects were needed to hit performance. With the increased performance of the Quest 2 we are not only able to restore these features, we are also able to increase the rendering resolution and re-enable a lot of visual effects making Apex Construct both look and sound amazing! I hope you will like it too!\"",

It’s so abrupt and does not explain a single thing. Through out the entire game you are made to believe that fathr is hiding something and then the game just ends. I had to go to YouTube to watch a video of the ending because of how abrupt it was, I was thinking maybe I missed something but nope that was the ending. I hope the explanation to this is that there will be a sequel to continue the story. I could easily accept this cliffhanger ending if it were for that but if not it would be a major disappointment. I totally would recommend this to friends and family, I’d warn them about the ending though.",
