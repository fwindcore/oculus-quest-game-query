							"body_text": "Hello everyone! It’s been a little less than one week since we’ve officially launched on the Oculus store, and we’ve been patiently reading all of your feedback. Thank you all!\n\nWe’d love to thank our existing members who gave us positive reviews, we appreciate it very much. Thank you for your patience as we worked to get to the store!\n\nMoreover, we’d love to thank newcomers for checking out HOLOFIT and giving constructive feedback, we always use it to improve our development roadmap.\n\nWe’ve also seen many questions since launch, so we are addressing those in this short post.\n\nWhy a subscription?\nBecause it’s the only way we can continue to bring monthly upgrades and updates to our community. Something new to motivate you to work out, every single month.\n\nWe are not a gaming company, we are a fitness company that uses gaming to push our users’ fitness to new highs. Subscription is a standard in the fitness industry, whether it’s the monthly membership you pay at your gym, your Peloton monthly membership subscription, or the monthly fee you pay for your Apple Fitness+.\n\nIt doesn’t work with my rowing machine/ bike/ elliptical.\n\nHOLOFIT connects to fitness machines over Bluetooth and not all machines work with HOLOFIT right out of the box. In some cases, you would need to add a cadence sensor to your elliptical/bicycle to enable a Bluetooth connection. \nPlease note that cadence sensors don’t work with rowing machines.\n\nCompatible rowing machines:\n- Concept 2 PM5\n- WaterRower with SmartRow or ComModule add-on\n- StairMaster HIIT rower\n- TechnoGym SkillRow\n- Domyos 500 rowing machine\n\nCompatible bikes:\n- Any bike with the additional cadence sensor\nOur recommendation: IGPSport C61 sensor\n\nCompatible elliptical machines:\n- Any wheel-based elliptical machine. The cadence sensor has to spin in a circular motion for it to work.\n\nWhat if I don’t have a fitness machine? \nYou can use HOLOFIT Freestyle with Oculus controllers to simulate rowing, running, and cycling using bodyweight exercises.\n\nIf your avatar is going too slow, pick up the pace! You really need to be swinging those arms, engaging your core and shoulders to go faster :)\n\nCan I use HOLOFIT Freestyle on my non-listed rowing machine?\nSome of our members use HOLOFIT Freestyle on their rowing machines by attaching the Oculus controllers on the rowing handlebar. However, note that your workout data won’t be as precise as when using HOLOFIT with the rowing machine.\n\nWe are preparing an update that would enable head tracking for this purpose so that you don’t have to attach the controllers to the handlebar.\n\nThe workout data shown in HOLOFIT is not accurate. \nWhen there is a direct connection between HOLOFIT and your rowing machine, there shouldn’t be any significant discrepancies between that data that your machine reports and the data HOLOFIT reports.\n\nHowever, if you have noticed a major discrepancy, please email support@holodia.com and let us know.\n\nThe Freestyle mode with Oculus controllers is moving really slowly for me. Am I doing something wrong?\n\nOur goal is to make you have a proper workout, and we do this by making you move as much as possible. HOLOFIT Freestyle tracks your hand controllers, and if your avatar is going too slow, pick up the pace!\n\nYou really need to be swinging those arms, engaging your core, arms, and shoulders to go faster :) And don’t forget about your legs. Engage your quads and your calves when running or cycling, by squatting and maybe even squat pulsing.\n\nWhat are the plans for the future? \nWe are preparing new worlds, new levels, new Freestyle workouts, new music and new Multiplayer challenges. And much more, but we will keep it as a surprise for now :)\n\nIs hand-tracking coming?\nYes!\n\nWhat about Google Fit/ Apple Health and other 3rd party fitness app integrations?\nThis will be a part of one of our next updates, currently under development.\n\nI don’t like the graphics.\nWe have a specific graphic style, it is an animated, original creation coming from our development team. You might love it (or maybe love it less), and we appreciate all your feedback and comments.\n\nWe are constantly working on improving graphics performance and quality, while still keeping our recognizable style.\n",

For $10/month i think devs should make this a better app in near future. \nFor me it would be much better for pay once a higher price, and when a new content is available i can decide if i like to buy that DLC or not. \n\nPlease consider, good luck!",
