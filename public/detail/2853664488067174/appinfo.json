Here‚Äôs what we‚Äôve done -\n\nGrand Sablon Desert V2: 10km/6.2mi Added to Explore, with 32 Trophies in Total\nThe Grand Sablon world is based on the longest foot race on Earth ‚Äì a six-day, 251 km (156 mi) ultramarathon through the Sahara desert. With the addition of 10km, the Grand Sablon desert is now 17 km (over 10 miles) long making it the perfect environment for endurance workouts.\n\nWe‚Äôve also added new trophies to the world, 32 in total. How many can you collect?\n\nNew Graphical Upgrades\nWe‚Äôve upgraded many graphical assets and also corrected lots of the visual glitches you helped identify!

You can burn up to 400 calories in a 30-minute session, although even doing it for 5 minutes will make a great impact on your muscles!\n\nHeadset tracking to enable controller-less rowing\n\nHeadset tracking is finally here! If you have a non-Bluetooth rowing machine, no need to attach your controllers to the handle anymore -\n\nGo into the HOLOFIT settings, select Fitness machine, and then select the Simple rower option, and you‚Äôre good to go!\n\nMany of you have been asking for this, and we‚Äôre very happy to be able to deliver! I hope you enjoy it üíñ\n\nRelax with the Zen Mode\n\nImmersive HOLOFIT worlds, amazing ambient music and sounds - and no distractions. Welcome, Zen mode!\n\nWe‚Äôve included a Zen mode switch in the Explore mode to enable total immersion where the only task is to relax and enjoy... Just you and the HOLOWORLD.\n\n\n\nGrand Sablon Desert Re-done\n\nNew trophies (no need to cramp your neck anymore :), adjusted graphics and additional assets, all for your better experience! We heard your feedback and went straight to work.\n\nWe‚Äôve also optimized our desert marathon for rowing machines! The ups and downs of the dunes in the desert should now be much, much easier for those of you on rowing machines.\n\nTry it and let us know!\n\nAdded Music Tracks\n\nAs always, you can expect new music! We‚Äôve added new tracks into our existing playlists, and we‚Äôre preparing a possible restructuring or addition of new music genres into HOLOFIT. We‚Äôll keep you posted!\n\nBugs & fixes\n\nFinally, we‚Äôve fixed numerous bugs as well as optimized some things in the background that should make for a smoother HOLOFIT experience!\n\nWhat‚Äôs next?\n\nGrand Sablon V2: we‚Äôll double up the Desert length, so you can do proper half-marathons.\n\nTrophies V2: We will start adding new huntables (trophies) and make them more interactive. This will mean a brand new gameplay to make your workouts even more fun!\n\nCyberpunk (coming this fall): we‚Äôve started working on bringing Cyberpunk environment to Quest! And we know you‚Äôre going to love it!\n\nChallenges and online events: We can see that you are enjoying our Spring Challenge so we have decided to organize them regularly. On top of that, expect many online events coming - it‚Äôs going to be loads of fun!\n\nAnd much more!!\n\nIf you have any questions, I am here to help - and as always, any feedback that you have would be much appreciated. I can‚Äôt wait to hear what you think!\n\nWe‚Äôve loved having you as part of the HOLOFIT community!\n\nEnjoy, \nTeam Holodia",

The other environments are less exciting and will hopefully get updated soon. I give the app 3 stars for delivering what it‚Äôs selling, which is a virtual environment that tracks your strokes on a rower in VR. I would give it another star if the graphics were better. I would also give it another star if the environments were more interactive. I wish the environments had an objective like ‚Äúbeing a policeman and having to chase a thief through a downtown Manhattan‚Äù, or ‚Äúrunning away from a Tyrannosaurus Rex‚Äù like the Jeep chase scene in Jurassic Park.",
