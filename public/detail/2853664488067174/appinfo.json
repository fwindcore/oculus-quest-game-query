And not just that-you‚Äôll lose up to 400 calories per session and kick-start your body into summer shape üòä\n\nDay 1\nLaunch HOLOFIT, select Freestyle/Skiing and Explore mode. Enjoy the Snowy Mountains environment, do a 20-minute relaxed workout, try and collect all the trophies and warm up your muscles for a day to follow.\n\nDay 2\nTest your cardio in HOLOFIT HIIT! Select HOLOFIT Freestyle/Skiing and then select CardioGoals/15-minute HIIT program. We‚Äôll leave it to you to select the difficulty level. Follow the effort curve and try to get your score above 85%. Your muscles will thank you for it üòä\n\nDay 3\nTry and see if you can do a better result than on day 1: head to HOLOFIT Freestyle/Skiing and this time jump into the Antarctica world and warm up at your own pace for 10 minutes. See how many trophies you can catch, and after finishing that one, jump into the magical world of Troglodytes. Take a full round through the whole world, and discover some of the exciting surprises in the magic mushroom and exploding turtles worlds. Sounds like fun?\n\nRemember: we provide the motivation and fun, but you have to do the work! The further down you go in squat and the more your arms work, the faster you‚Äôll go.\n\nYou‚Äôll see first results after these 3 days, and after you subscribe we‚Äôll make sure you get motivating workouts every single day.\n\nTry it today!",
