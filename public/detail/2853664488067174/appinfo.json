							"created_time": 1615906299,
							"body_text": "It‚Äôs time to celebrate: the new HOLOFIT Go update is here!\n\nHere‚Äôs what‚Äôs new:\n\nNew HOLOWORLD: The Grand Sablon\nYou asked for longer, more endurance-focused, sporty environments, and we listened -\n\nwelcome the desert of Grand Sablon, our longest and most challenging environment so far!\n\nGrand Sablon will test your endurance in the toughest of conditions while you explore the great desert and improve your fitness.\n\nAlthough it is based on the longest foot race on Earth - a six-day, 251 km (156 mi) ultramarathon through Sahara desert, and is amazing to use for your elliptical or HOLOFIT Freestyle running, it is also a great challenge for rowers and bicyclists that want to test and improve their endurance.\n\nIn Version 1 of the Grand Sablon, you will have to go through almost 8 kilometers/5 miles of sand dunes, lush oasis, and surprising Egyptian Sphinx. Version 2 will double this length and is coming to you very soon.\n\nDid you know? The Marathon des Sables was the brainchild of French concert promoter Patrick Bauer who in 1984 traversed the Sahara desert on foot and alone. He covered 350 km (214 mi) in 12 days without encountering a single oasis or desert community along the way.\n\nMultiplayer Voice Chat\nThe first part of our Multiplayer rework is here: the lobby voice chat!\n\nWhen you enter the Online Multiplayer lobby and while waiting for the race to start, you‚Äôll now be able to talk to your competitors. This will enable you to discuss race length, environment selection, or anything else that is of interest. Please make sure you treat others the way you would want to be treated yourself!\n\nThe lobby is, for now, the only point where you can use this feature. However, we plan to enable voice chat for the race end, so you can review your scores, cheer on each other and have fun with your achievements.\n\nMore multiplayer updates coming soon!\n\nLowered CardioGoals Arch Sensitivity\nWe‚Äôve lowered the sensitivity of CardioGoals arches which may have given you problems. You‚Äôve told us that, in some cases, the arches were ‚Äútoo sensitive‚Äù.\n\nWe‚Äôve tested and agreed. Thank you for giving us your feedback on this, we appreciate the help!\n\nTime Attack Sounds Lowered\nAs we plan our full Time Attack rework for the next quarter, we wanted to provide a quick fix that many of you asked for:\n\nThe proximity sounds have now been lowered so as not to interfere with your session.\n\nWe‚Äôd love your feedback on this, try it out and let us know!\n\nNew Music\nAnother month brings around more new songs! \nWe‚Äôve added at least five new songs to each of the playlists. We hope that you enjoy it!\n\nIf you have preferences or genres you would like to hear, just let us know!\n\nNew Demo HOLOWORLD\nUsers who try HOLOFIT in the demo mode will now be able to test the mysterious world of Troglodyte!\n\nVarious Bugs & Fixes\nAs always, there are various bugs and fixes in this update including the HUD selection jitter and the unlocking of Freestyle for the users who were impacted.\n\nAs always, we‚Äôre looking forward to hearing your feedback on this update. And if you have any other questions, don‚Äôt hesitate to get in touch.\n\nP.S. If you haven't yet reviewed HOLOFIT, please leave a review here. We really appreciate it as it helps us spread the word about HOLOFIT.\n\nThank you, and stay HOLOFIT!",

							"created_time": 1612954694,
							"body_text": "Hey HOLOFITTERS üëã\n\nWe are working hard on preparing updates for the next quarter, and I wanted to share our plans with you.\n\nYou‚Äôve sent us many ideas and suggestions through our Facebook community and via email, and thank you for that. You help us make HOLOFIT as good as it can get! üíñ\n\nHere is what's coming:\n\nBrand New Environment Coming Soon üåµ\n\nYou have been training really well the last few months: averaging 2.8 daily workouts per member! Now‚Äôs the time to increase the efforts and that‚Äôs why we are preparing a more challenging environment for you: The Desert!\n\n\n\nYou will take part in a Sahara desert race, pushing yourself up and down the sandy dunes, lustrous hills, and refreshing oasis.\n\nThe Desert environment has been inspired by the Marathon des Sables, the 156mi (251km) toughest race on Earth. We have of course made it with the special HOLOFIT artistry, so expect to be surprised and entertained!\n\nHOLOWORLDs Reinvented Continues üéÅ\n            \nYou‚Äôve loved how we upgraded the Snowy Mountains, Canyon, and Antarctica, and we will continue to do this with the rest of our HOLOWORLDs. New assets, better graphics, and a few extra surprises will reinvent all of our HOLOWORLDs.\n\nConnected HOLOWORLDs üåÖ\n\nWe‚Äôve also heard you asking for the option to move from one HOLOWORLD to another one in-game, so we are implementing the ‚Äúteleporting‚Äù option. After a full lap in your selected environment, you will be given an option to be launched in another one, directly from your current session.\n\nMultiplayer V2 for Community Events and More Motivation üßìüë¥üë¶üëßüßëüë®üë©\n\nAs our community is growing so are the opportunities to utilize the Online Multiplayer function. We will enable Voice chat in the Online Multiplayer, you will be able to speak with other HOLOFIT members in the Multiplayer lobby, and at the end of each race.\n\nWe will also enable a queue feature: you will be able to choose to ‚Äúget in line‚Äù for the next Multiplayer race and get a notification when it‚Äôs ready. \nAnd we will bring all the current HOLOWORLDs to the Online Multiplayer, so you‚Äôll have plenty of choices of environments for your races.\n\nThis will be only the start, and we will aim to have enhanced Online Multiplayer challenges and the Invitation system ready for you in the months to come.\n\n‚ÄúZen‚Äù Game Mode ‚úå\n\nMany of you enjoy the meditative experience HOLOFIT can offer and would like to have less data when working out. We will take care of this by offering you the Zen mode, in which you will be able to switch off everything but the beautiful HOLOFIT worlds.\n\nEnjoy HOLOWORLDs at your own pace, in your own time, without any distractions.\n\nEasier Rowing for Non-Compatible Rowing Machines: Head Tracking üö£‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüö£‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è\n\nYou‚Äôve been great at using controllers and finding ways to make HOLOFIT work on your non-compatible rowing machines. It hasn‚Äôt been the best experience though, we know it and that‚Äôs why we are launching the Head tracking option.\n\nYou will be able to use HOLOFIT on any rowing machine, with all the advantages HOLOFIT rowing has to offer.\n\nNordic Skiing üéø\nDid you try skiing through our HOLOWORLDs? You will be able to do just that with the new HOLOFIT Freestyle Nordic skiing feature.\n\nWe wanted to put more emphasis on lower body muscle workouts, and skiing is perfect for giving your thighs, calves, and butt a better shape and more strength.  We will not limit skiing to Freestyle though, HOLOFIT on Ski erg machines will follow as well!\n\nHOLOFIT Companion App and Platform Availability Upgrades üì±\n\nWe are also going to update the HOLOFIT Companion app!\n\nIf you are not yet using it, please do so, it‚Äôs available on Android and iOS. After we do the update, the Companion app will enable you to directly connect your Strava account, or your Apple Health kit and Google fit to your HOLOFIT profile.\n\nWe will also enable better interaction between members through the app, including challenging and race scheduling options.\n\nAnd much more‚Ä¶..\n\nWe will be doing regular improvements and bug fixes, and we‚Äôll also keep on incorporating fixes on issues reported by our community.\n\nI‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre as excited as we are to experience all the novelties, we‚Äôll share our regular February update details at the end of the month.\n\nStay well, stay safe and stay HOLOFIT!\n\nP.S. If you haven't yet, make sure to join our Facebook community: it's the place to connect with other HOLOFIT members!\n",

							"reviewDescription": "On the plus side, was lookimg for a fitness app where i can casually jog through beautiful 3-d worlds.   While a bit lo-res, this app meets that criterion nicely.     However, a number of issues prevent a higher rating:\n1.  Need to get out my iphone & reauthorize every time I start the app.   I have lots of apps with iap, no others make me do this.\n2.  Almost all worlds are locked, even after I have purchased a subscription.   If I‚Äôm spending $$$ continuously, should have access to all content.\n3.  Words ‚ÄúNot authorized for commercial use‚Äù are continually in my field of vision.\n4.  No setting to calibrate movement sensitivity.   I think the jogging setting was tested by Olympic athletes, not over-50s (like me) trying to get in better shape.    The snails pace I jog at is very frustrating, though the bicycle setting is acceptable.\n5.  Minimal HUD- why not display distance traveled & remaining on track, etc?\n6.  If I dont finish a level fast enough, music stops & i move in silence, rather than restarting the music loop.\n\n\nUpdate:   Kudos to the support team for reaching me within 1 day of the above posting.   Turns out the app was somehow still in demo mode (despite no explicit notice of this on the screen, and no option to re-display the sync code.). After a few reboots & re-login on my iPhone & quest, I now have access to all levels, without the ugly non-commercial warning!    However, my other points above still stand.  To earn another star, app should add a robust in-app account management/sync menu.",
