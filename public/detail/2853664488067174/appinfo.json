							"body_text": "Hey HOLOFITTERS üëã\n\nWe are working hard on preparing updates for the next quarter, and I wanted to share our plans with you.\n\nYou‚Äôve sent us many ideas and suggestions through our Facebook community and via email, and thank you for that. You help us make HOLOFIT as good as it can get! üíñ\n\nHere is what's coming:\n\nBrand New Environment Coming Soon üåµ\n\nYou have been training really well the last few months: averaging 2.8 daily workouts per member! Now‚Äôs the time to increase the efforts and that‚Äôs why we are preparing a more challenging environment for you: The Desert!\n\n\n\nYou will take part in a Sahara desert race, pushing yourself up and down the sandy dunes, lustrous hills, and refreshing oasis.\n\nThe Desert environment has been inspired by the Marathon des Sables, the 156mi (251km) toughest race on Earth. We have of course made it with the special HOLOFIT artistry, so expect to be surprised and entertained!\n\nHOLOWORLDs Reinvented Continues üéÅ\n            \nYou‚Äôve loved how we upgraded the Snowy Mountains, Canyon, and Antarctica, and we will continue to do this with the rest of our HOLOWORLDs. New assets, better graphics, and a few extra surprises will reinvent all of our HOLOWORLDs.\n\nConnected HOLOWORLDs üåÖ\n\nWe‚Äôve also heard you asking for the option to move from one HOLOWORLD to another one in-game, so we are implementing the ‚Äúteleporting‚Äù option. After a full lap in your selected environment, you will be given an option to be launched in another one, directly from your current session.\n\nMultiplayer V2 for Community Events and More Motivation üßìüë¥üë¶üëßüßëüë®üë©\n\nAs our community is growing so are the opportunities to utilize the Online Multiplayer function. We will enable Voice chat in the Online Multiplayer, you will be able to speak with other HOLOFIT members in the Multiplayer lobby, and at the end of each race.\n\nWe will also enable a queue feature: you will be able to choose to ‚Äúget in line‚Äù for the next Multiplayer race and get a notification when it‚Äôs ready. \nAnd we will bring all the current HOLOWORLDs to the Online Multiplayer, so you‚Äôll have plenty of choices of environments for your races.\n\nThis will be only the start, and we will aim to have enhanced Online Multiplayer challenges and the Invitation system ready for you in the months to come.\n\n‚ÄúZen‚Äù Game Mode ‚úå\n\nMany of you enjoy the meditative experience HOLOFIT can offer and would like to have less data when working out. We will take care of this by offering you the Zen mode, in which you will be able to switch off everything but the beautiful HOLOFIT worlds.\n\nEnjoy HOLOWORLDs at your own pace, in your own time, without any distractions.\n\nEasier Rowing for Non-Compatible Rowing Machines: Head Tracking üö£‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüö£‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è\n\nYou‚Äôve been great at using controllers and finding ways to make HOLOFIT work on your non-compatible rowing machines. It hasn‚Äôt been the best experience though, we know it and that‚Äôs why we are launching the Head tracking option.\n\nYou will be able to use HOLOFIT on any rowing machine, with all the advantages HOLOFIT rowing has to offer.\n\nNordic Skiing üéø\nDid you try skiing through our HOLOWORLDs? You will be able to do just that with the new HOLOFIT Freestyle Nordic skiing feature.\n\nWe wanted to put more emphasis on lower body muscle workouts, and skiing is perfect for giving your thighs, calves, and butt a better shape and more strength.  We will not limit skiing to Freestyle though, HOLOFIT on Ski erg machines will follow as well!\n\nHOLOFIT Companion App and Platform Availability Upgrades üì±\n\nWe are also going to update the HOLOFIT Companion app!\n\nIf you are not yet using it, please do so, it‚Äôs available on Android and iOS. After we do the update, the Companion app will enable you to directly connect your Strava account, or your Apple Health kit and Google fit to your HOLOFIT profile.\n\nWe will also enable better interaction between members through the app, including challenging and race scheduling options.\n\nAnd much more‚Ä¶..\n\nWe will be doing regular improvements and bug fixes, and we‚Äôll also keep on incorporating fixes on issues reported by our community.\n\nI‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre as excited as we are to experience all the novelties, we‚Äôll share our regular February update details at the end of the month.\n\nStay well, stay safe and stay HOLOFIT!\n\nP.S. If you haven't yet, make sure to join our Facebook community: it's the place to connect with other HOLOFIT members!\n",

You‚Äôre going to see mixed reviews on this so let me explain why that may be - Expectations.  \n\nAt first I was a little disappointed because I thought it would be like a real world. All of it is animation. It‚Äôs kind of like the old Viewmaster. But let me tell you this app does exactly what I want. It distracts me. I don‚Äôt own any machines at all, I just use it to walk in place and listen to my music of choice. \n\nThis app provides the exact distraction that I need to make 30 minutes go by very fast. I‚Äôm looking around at some really cool worlds and there are some great surprises... like a giant whale jumping over my head. Or a crocodile jumping out to scare me. I have walked through the worlds several times and always notice something new. As far as I know there is no other app like this one. Go in there knowing that the graphics are not the greatest in the world and go in there knowing that you‚Äôre just going to have fun looking around at what the developers have in store for you. There are lots of fun surprises! I rate this app ‚Äúworth it to me‚Äù!!;)",
