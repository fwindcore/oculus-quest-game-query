							"reviewDescription": "I just got started with vSpatial and have to say I am impressed. My office has never looked so good and clutter-free! No cords, no papers, no I’ll-get-to-it-later piles. Nothing but screens. I love it.\n\nI had my work-mood tunes playing on my computer when I first connected to it. Almost immediately, the music automatically switched to playing thru my headset. For a brief moment, the surprise made me think I had been transported to that VR office. I had to chuckle.\n\nThis solution delivers in making a remote VR connection to your computer(s) a breeze and an environment you can get pampered with. The biggest problem I had was struggling to find the at-symbol (@) on the virtual keyboard to sign into my new account. Hint: press the shift key for special characters! Another hint: if you have trouble with using the trigger to press virtual keys, try the A/X button on your remote.\n\nI've been writing the Product Developer. He had an answer or solution-pending for all of the minor issues I could point-out. If you're considering this app for a VR remote connection solution, do try it. You won't regret it.\n\nGilliosa, regarding your enhancement requests: \n\n(1) Hand tracking - I agree, this would be great. Given the precision loss, I don't see it as useful enough yet though. I'd rather see the technology mature first. But, eventual integration is inevitable.\n\n(2) Additional carousels - I think you are wanting carousel sets, the ability to pull down a set of apps/connections, just like you would an individual app. Intriguing thought. I like it.\n\n(3) Multiple full screens - You might be missing the point of \"full\" screen. Simply allowing a bigger carousel might be what you are really after.\n\n(4) and (5) Mouse right-click and ...physical keyboard - You can use a real mouse and keyboard connected by Bluetooth/USB, although you might have to sneak peek at your keyboard every now and then.\n\n(5) VR/AR keyboard - Stay tuned, friend. That wish may be closer to coming true than you think.",
