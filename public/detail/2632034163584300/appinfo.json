							"reviewDescription": "The content in B-Team is made up of three different game modes, an endless runner, on-rails shooter and challenges mode. The game starts with the runner mode, which is an odd choice considering there aren’t any anti-sickness options and being thrust in to fast forward motion like that might at first put many people off. You’ll unlock each game mode in order, so to play the shooter mode you need to complete a runner level and to play a challenge mode you’ll need to complete a shooter level. There’s no way to skip or pay to pass levels if you get stuck, so if you can’t complete a certain mission, it could all come to an abrupt end.\n\nIn the runner mode, you’ll have to move left and right, collecting medals and avoiding obstacles, you’ll have on-the-fly choice of four characters, each with their own abilities such as sweeping for mines and jumping long distances, you’ll need to use each of them to get as far as possible – this mode isn’t dissimilar to games like Temple Run or Subway Surfers. The shooter mode has you mostly stood still while you take out incoming enemies and projectiles from corner to corner, each character again uses different weapons that are more effective depending on what you’re shooting – if you’ve played titles like Time Crisis or Virtua Cop then this mode will be familiar to you. Challenge mode will have you solving puzzles and completing mini-challenges, this mode has the most variety of all three.\n\nWhile B-Team has enough content to keep you occupied it isn’t going to be blowing your mind, at least not at this point in VR’s evolution. It has incredibly simple graphics, no real accessibility options and feels like a minimal effort Oculus Go port where you’ll never be using both controllers at the same time. But its simple fun if you have a spare 30 minutes to kill every now and then.\n\nRead the full review and more here: https://www.opiumpulses.com/article/424/10-oculus-quest-2-game-reviews-part-3",
