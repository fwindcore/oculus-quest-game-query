							"reviewDescription": "I have owned my Quest for a year, and have played every major game with 4 stars, or higher rating. Nevertheless I have never rated, nor commented on a game before this.\n\nWhere do I start with this game... Well first you should know that this is not a game; it is more of an experience. If you are a fan of anime, or the light novels which anime are based upon you will love this game. \n\nMost Quest games can be beat within hours, yet this took me a week to finish. You are trying get the best ending. If you have ever watch the animes Re:ZERO or Steins Gate you will know the struggles of trying to achieve a future where everyone is happy; except now you’re living it instead of simply watching it. \n\nThat may sound repetitive, but in actuality once you unlock an alternate future a whole new story and background reveals itself. In other words with most Oculus games once you play it and beat it-it’s finish. There will be nothing new, but with THIS game if you pick the right combination of choices you can experience an entirely different adventure each time. You’re basically getting several games, or to be more accurate, several series of a novel for the price of one!\n\nThere were times when I thought of giving up on this game after re-experiencing the same scenario dozens of times, but something just didn’t feel right about the bad endings so I kept at it, trying different choice combinations. HINT: being nice isn’t always the right choice.\n\nAgain talking to my anime fans, there is an opening sequence like on animes that once you unlock it you will not be able to help but to go back to it over and over again. However, this time instead of just watching it you’re actually inside and experiencing an opening anime song! It’s one of the coolest things I’ve experienced on Oculus. Something I have realize is that once you become emotionally invested in the characters the songs hit you differently, because again unlike reading a novel, or watching an anime you’re actually there experiencing it all with the characters in the first person. Being able to become emotionally attached to characters is something other games don’t allow.\n\nThere are some specific things I would love to address from other negative reviews I have read about this game, but unfortunately I cannot because they may turn into spoilers. Again this is about the experience and discovery, just know that everything in this game is designed to be that way for a reason and if you stick with it long enough you will understand that reason.\n\nThe emotional attachment of having literally lived dozens of lives with the same characters and seeing their joys, their hurt, and struggling along side them like YOU would with a real person is why I say this is literally the BEST game that Quest has to date.\n\nHint: When analyzing the waves of the enemy DON’T press any of the side buttons put your hand on the middle one Only...",
