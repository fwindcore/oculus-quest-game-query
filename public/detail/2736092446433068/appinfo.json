							"reviewDescription": "We were very excited about this game when it was first revealed, Penn and Teller are legendary magicians by this point who have inspired countless others all around the world to get into magic. The idea of the game is to learn tricks and then act them out to your friends and family. The absolutely cringey game name (that you can tell the people involved find genuinely hilarious) stands for “Frankly Unfair, Unkind, Unnecessary, & Underhanded”, but the only U we really find is relevant here is the third one.\n\nWhile the concept is a great idea and there is more than enough content to justify the price, we can’t help but feel like there was a lot of missed opportunities to come up with magic tricks that would actually amaze those you perform them with. Instead, it feels like mostly pranks aimed to scare or make a fool of people, to the point where it actually asks you to grab your friend very suddenly while they can see a shotgun aimed at them, we kind of found ourselves wondering when the lowkey bullying would end and the magic would begin, we sadly didn’t end up that lucky.\n\nWhile we’re big fans of Penn and Teller as entertainers, we couldn’t help but notice how much Penn loves the sound of his own voice, babbling on far more than is necessary to teach you the tricks. If you bought this shortly before having family or friends over, they’d have to sit around for 30-60 minutes while you wade through endless dialogue and tutorials just to learn a very simple trick. This isn’t a show Penn and Teller, it’s a video game, a video game that’s potential was sawed in half.\n\nSince our review was published the official (and essential) companion app has also stopped working and seemingly nothing is being done to fix it, so we're dropping our review by a further star - typical Gearbox.\n\nRead the full review and more here: https://www.opiumpulses.com/article/411/10-more-oculus-quest-game-reviews-p2",
