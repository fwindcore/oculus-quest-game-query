You would grab them and show them the way.\n\nWe hope to give you more interesting details on creating the game in the future. But until then,\n\nSee you in Wonderland!",

							"created_time": 1619704333,
							"body_text": "In Down the Rabbit Hole, you can meet lots of memorable characters during your journey through Wonderland. They were all created with love and with special care for every single detail.\n\nWe asked our 2D graphic artists, Alex Bengtsson and Max Huusko, what they think about the characters:\n\nWhat is your favorite character from the game and why?\n- Alex: Probably the King of Spades. I love all his dialogues with his \"smart\" friends. I've been watching some players do a playthrough on YouTube and I love that so many seem to share that with me!\n- Max: 4 1/2, I love all his card puns!\n\nTell us more about making this favorite character of yours:\n- Alex: (Probably the King of Spades) I wasn't part of the final design, although I did some sketches of him in early pre-production. I remember making an early sketch of him, where his throne was a large stand-in with a pattern of a King of Spades-card. I really liked that idea although it ended up just as nice with the current design!\n- Max: (4 1/2) I made a few quite bizarre versions of him with real, human legs and stuff that I’m glad we scrapped. In the end, we tried to make him as 2D as possible. I don’t remember when we chose to go with a Spanish Conquistador look for him, but I think it suits him well.\n\nWhich character was the most fun to create and why?\n- Alex: I really liked working on the cook. Although she's quite different from John Tenniel's illustrations - it feels like we landed a fun design and a fun personality.\n- Max: I really enjoyed the caterpillar even if I wasn’t a big part of its creation. He used to be voiced by a guy in the office next to ours and he had the coolest voice, kinda wished we had kept him in.\n\nWhich character was the most difficult to create and why?\n- Alex: The main character probably. We wanted to give her a strong personality without her looking like a superhero. So there was a lot of iteration to get her to a place that felt just right.\n- Max: I think the main character was the one we spent the most time on for obvious reasons, it’s the main protagonist so we obviously want players to engage with her. I think we had a clear vision with her from the start though, so I don’t think we struggled too hard with her.\n\nWhich character do you think gets the least love and why?\n- Alex: The trumpet guy next to the king of spades. He's such a talented guy that deserves better!\n- Max: I wonder how many players get to see all three versions of Patches.\n\nIf you could, what type of character would you add to the game?\n- Alex: There are so many, but I really miss Tweedledee & Tweedledum. I think that would add a ton to an already fun dialogue!\n- Max: Definitely the fish footman!",

I haven t touched it since. 20 bucks for 5 minutes of pulling my hair out trying to figure out what I should be doing to have fun. Its me. Im dumb.\nUPDATE...\nOK. I never meant the game wasent cool. Im not cool but I took what the developers suggested and applied it to my struggles which indeed has helped immensely. I just needed to chill a bit. Its a game a GREAT GAME A SOLID TRIP DOWN THE RABBIT HOLE. I just needed to pack a little suitcase of survival skills to take with me on my first trip. Thank you to who replied to my pity party. Thank you for an entire treasure chest of information. Its true people if you get stuck fall back on You Tube cause it'll catch you and help you back into the game. Without your suggestion I wouldve missed out on an incredible journey down the rabbit hole. Two...three oh what the hell 168 thumbs up.",
