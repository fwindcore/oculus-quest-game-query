							"body_text": "One Year of Down the Rabbit Hole!\n\nTime flies, folks!\n\nToday, it has been a whole year since we opened up the gates to our virtual reality Wonderland. We created a world where up is down and down is up. Little did we know that the real world would turn out the same. We are glad to have provided so many of you with another world to escape to during these difficult times.\n\nStay safe, and thank you!\n\nDown the Rabbit Hole Fun Facts!\n\nEven though DTRH has become well known to VR adventurers worldwide, few details have been revealed about the game’s making. We now want to celebrate our One Year Anniversary by sharing 5 things you didn’t know about Down the Rabbit Hole!\n\n#1 - The Pit before Wonderland\nThe original proof of concept had nothing to do with Alice in Wonderland. Back then, the diorama was a dark and twisted place called “The Pit.” At the beginning of the game, the little house is the only object that made it all the way from the proof of concept to the final game.\n\n#2 - The Mirror Realm vs Cortopia Studios\nDuring months of playtesting, the Mirror Realm was our developers’ biggest nemesis. This part of the game tended to break down almost every time it was played.\n\n#3 - “Scaramanga”\nFor a long time, the project’s code name was “Scaramanga,” named after the James Bond villain with the same name. In our shared drives, references can still be found, confusing the hell out of our team’s newer members.\n\n#4 - A hand-painted Wonderland\nAll the characters in Down the Rabbit Hole are hand-animated by Cortopia Studios’ Concept and 3D Artists. The same goes for the textures, which have high levels of hand-painted details throughout the game.\n\n#5 - Easter Eggs\nSeveral Easter Eggs have been hidden in DTRH. Pay close attention as you tumble through. Next time you tumble through Wonderland, pay close attention, and you might find: Hidden “Help me” notes from our team, the sound of a classic “Wilhelm Scream,” and photos of Cortopia Studios’ two office dogs Purjo and Bobo, among other things!\n",

							"created_time": 1616081959,
							"body_text": "Women’s History Month is here, and Oculus is celebrating it by introducing a new Collection Experience. “Female and Fearless!” contains 8 VR titles with female main characters. Cortopia Studios’ Alice in Wonderland puzzler Down the Rabbit Hole is one of the games included.\n\n“This is a great initiative from Oculus. Female protagonists are still vastly underrepresented in games overall, but the gap is shrinking. It’s important to shine a light on VR games that break the pattern, and we are very proud to contribute to the change”, says Ricky Helgesson, Head of Studio at Cortopia.\n\nThe story about the girl who ventures through a diorama-Wonderland has been enjoyed by VR players worldwide. Alexander Bengtsson is one of the Cortopia concept artists who developed the game’s main character:\n\n“In the beginning, we had loads of iterations on style. We decided to settle for a less hero-like version of her, and we worked a lot with personal details. Her fiery red hair, freckles, big eyes and rosy cheeks are examples of such details.”\n\nDown the Rabbit Hole takes place in the Wonderland that author Lewis Carroll created in the 1800s. Unlike in the book, the protagonist girl in the game is not Alice. This story unfolds before Carroll’s original story. To the Cortopia team, it felt natural to go with a female main character for this Wonderland story too.\n\n“It was always a girl, from the first sketch to release day, and it was never really questioned by anyone. It just felt right to tell the story this way, and it was also a breath of fresh air to our team”, says Alexander.\n\nWe are so proud of the Female & Fearless Collections, and we are looking forward to seeing more female main characters in VR games!\n",
