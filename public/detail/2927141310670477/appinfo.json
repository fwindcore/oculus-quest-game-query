Since going into lockdown, our studio has not had the possibility to meet our professors for in-person teaching, until some of us started using spatial. Now we can show, move, and look at our designs again in 3D \"in person\" - which is amazing now that all physical models are out of the question. However I am having massive troubles with importing a large amount of files into the rooms. Once I reach a certain numbers of 3D objects, the whole room starts moving after my head movement and there's no stopping it. I have to quit the whole app in order no to get completely sea sick. I currently have a room I can't enter due to it being  completely glitched. If these issues could be fixed I would give 5 of 5 stars. Cus the collaboration aspect is brilliant.",
