Rockey flees, unable to salvage her personal belongings. \nThrough interactivity, explore Rockey’s personal objects, objects that hold Rockey’s memories and illustrate her past. Pick up her journal to reveal an animated poem, the story of the first homeless man Rockey saw when she was ten. Find a small wooden box filled with Rockey’s photos. Wind up a music box to hear Rockey’s dream of having a home again. Pick up a small cut out of a motorcycle and open up a psychedelic animation telling the story of the day Rockey got married on the back of a motorcycle on her way to Sturges. Finally, a novel from Rockey’s childhood opens to reveal an animation of Rockey’s last desire - to be a cowboy. ",

I was homeless in Philly for TWO YEARS, lived in a tent, my things weren't dirty, just, cuze ur stuff isn't dirty, don't mean ur not homeless and just, cuze you are homeless, don't mean you have to live dirty!! Also, i hate to brake it to you, but the cops DO EXACTLY this and so do the garbage man! I've had this done to me several times, almost every day at one point.. Being only 19 years old, with nothing.. The cops would target me on purpose and bother me, more than anyone else, cuze i was pretty and young and they thought I was the easiest to harras, but they also did what you see right here in this video to everyone else! They throw away EVERYTHING you have! Even ur blankets, pillows, clothes, the only thing keeping you warm and sheltered and they do it on purpose , cuze they think it is funny! They will wait till a big snow storm or rain storm is coming or wait till it is nearly dark, so we can't get shelter or find help.. The cops DO, DO THIS, so to you people saying this is attacking the cops, no they are not, cuze the cops do this on a daily basis, they like it, it is a power trip and they laugh at you and your misfortunes, they do it to everyone.. I'm not homeless anymore, but I have never had ONE SINGLE good experience with a cop that helped me, EVER! The cops would have Narcan in their cars and vans, cuze so many homeless people would OD right in front of them.. Than they wouldn't use it, they would let the person die, cuze they think they are just a homeless drug addict, who cares about them, they don't matter, but that is someone's something, that person matters to someone and is someone's Mother/Father, Sister/Brother, Aunt/Uncle, Neice/Nephew, Daughter/Son, you get it, the list goes on! Sick of ppl making EVERYTHING about the cops, this is about homelessness, NOT the cops! Their is one good cop in every 5,000, and you will be VERY lucky to find THAT one! 100%",
