I got two, but only one of them was affecting gameplay, and not by much.\nThe Comfort Vintage? You can turn that off. (Its the movement circle thing)\nApp Sharing? Multiplayer exclusive games usually don't game share.\nToxic Teammates? I haven't encountered them at all, but if you do, when you're in the lobby, go to settings and find the setting to lower or raise the volume of team chat, then set it to zero.\nPeople complaining about the microphone always being active? Just turn the microphone off in the settings.\n\nAnd to the people who may be complaining about no teleport movement option, teleport movement would ruin the game entirely.\n\nI will say though, there needs to be a way to change keybinds, I hate pressing the  right joystick to empty my gun, its really uncomfortable, and I think pressing X would be a lot better.\n\nOverall its a really good game, me and my friends have had a really good time on it!",
