							"reviewDescription": "So this game has good graphics and stuff, but I have a few recommendations.\n\n1. You should add a sandbox mode. It would be nice to be able to just hang out and explore the map.\n2. You should add a pistol only mode. Basically, the only weapons are pistols. I love using pistols in this game but they’re pretty much useless when it comes to combat.\n3. You should add two holsters that don’t take up backpack space. One for a rifle to go on your back, and another for a pistol on your hip. \n4. You should add characters to the store.\n5. You should make it a little easier to level up. I’ve been stuck on level 12 for a while now.\n\nThat’s it. This is a great game, so keep up the good work!\n\nSincerely,   \n                 MyCatIsADogYes",
