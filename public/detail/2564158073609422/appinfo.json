							"reviewDescription": "I haven't played video games regularly in years. The newest system I own (before this) is an N64. (And btw, all FPS are still measured against Goldeneye).\n\nAnd this game beat Goldeneye. It definitely has a learning curve. You will not be good at this game right away. The tutorial is a bit lacking, but now with the addition of the bot battles you can get some practice in for the real games.\n\nI read through a bunch of the 1 Star reviews for this game and found a few themes.\n\n1. Parents complaining they bought this game for their kids and were appalled at the killing aspect of the game or the profane speech of some teammates. Parents, DO NOT BUY THIS FOR YOUR KIDS!!!!!!!!!! This is a teen and above game. And I'd even say late teens.\n\n2. People complaining about super rude teammates. I've played almost 400 games by now, and maybe my experience has been different from most, but the VAST majority of my teammates, even if they suck, have been reasonably respectful. By far the most disrespectful are the kids. The kids cuss and swear and scream far more than any adults I've played with. I had one kid who insisted on dropping straight to the cemetery against our advice, die within 30 seconds, call us trash and a bunch of other profane names and left.\n\n3. Then there are the guys that complain about the mechanics; \"reloading is too many steps and complicated\" (obviously written by a person who has never handled a real gun), \"you have to peel a banana four times before you can eat it\" (yeah, like a real banana except you don't have to worry about squishing it while you peel it), \"the guns are inaccurate,\" (try shooting a real gun. I assure you hitting someone in this game is far easier than the real thing).\n\nI have my nitpicks with the game as well, particularly coming from a firearms background, but overall I am highly impressed by the game. The better your teamwork the more likely you are to play a good game and win. Legitimate squad tactics (to an extent) are applicable here.",
