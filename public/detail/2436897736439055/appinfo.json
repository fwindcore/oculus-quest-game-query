							"reviewDescription": "I recently purchased both Onward and Contractors to make a comparison for my gaming group (12 quest owners) of mixed player types, most who have never played a FPS game before. We are looking for a nice multiplayer game where we could have most of us play together on a private server. I will post each individual review in the respective game section, but I do often compare them both during my review. So if you are on the fence about either one, read on, then check the other game review for the other info.\n\nLong story short, if you had to choose only one, I think Contractors is the better way to go since it offers so many different options of gameplay. Playing solo, coop or private server multiplayer are all very satisfying. However, both games are really fun. I am glad I own both.\n\nContractors:\n\nStart up zone: is fantastic, it has multiple mini-games that help with learning basic shooting and aiming in different situations. There is even a zombie button to press... haven't survived this yet. Menu system is activated via a button press (B/Y), this can be changed in the settings to the menu button which makes more sense.\n\nTutorial: is best I have seen for a FPS VR game. But doesn't cover every weapon.\n\nClasses: similar 4 basic classes as Onward, but there are no separate factions.\n\nGame Mechanics: only smooth movement is available, no teleport. The movement is faster than Onward and is more prone to motion sickness, but it might take a session or two to get used to it (build up VR legs). Crouching and going prone is done in real time, which means you really have to do it in real life. There is no button to push to make this happen. It helps to have a little extra play space so that you can make quick minor movements to get in cover and peak around walls. You have to do all this with your real body.\n\nGame Graphics: are pretty good, better than Arizona Sunshine and a little better than Onward.\n\nGameplay: It's not overly difficult to figure out. Can be up and running after the tutorial screens are complete (15 mins or so). For weapons and technical operations such as reloading, pulling pins and throwing grenades: very similar to Onward, very realistic and well done. There is still a bit of a learning curve to figuring out each weapon's special operation. For example I had a really tough time understanding how to reload the Magnum (revolver). Game feels a bit more arcade-like, similar to Battlefield 1942.\n\nGame Maps: good choice of maps, not overly huge, feels about right size. I haven't seen a night version yet, so I am not sure night goggles are an option.\n\nCommunication: You can talk freely with anyone within range and you can use the radio to communicate longer distances. There is even a settings option to remove the need for push to talk, which is a welcomed feature. Oculus Group voice chat seems to work sometimes. However, some lost the ability to communicate all together once a game match started. We found if you leave the Oculus group before starting the game, all will work fine.\n\nSingle player and Coop: is very well done with plenty of game mode options. Enemy AI Bots are pretty decent, better than Onward. Didn't see an option to change the difficulty or the number.\n\nPrivate multiplayer: allows up to 10 players (up to 5 vs 5) and can be mixed in with AI Bots to fill teams as needed. There are 9+ game modes. AI Bots are well done, they don't appear to take main objectives (such as capturing flags or setting bombs) they are focused on gun fights. They leave all the key objectives for the players to take care of. Good design.\n\nFinal thoughts: it's a pretty polished game. I think this is the easiest to get into especially for those not familiar with FPS type games.",
