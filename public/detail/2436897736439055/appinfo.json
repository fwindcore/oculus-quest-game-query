							"reviewDescription": "Let me start by saying if you want something as close as possible to COD or Counter-Strike in VR look no further!! This is the most polished, feature rich multiplayer FPS on Quest/Quest 2...Other current FPS games don’t even come close. Although “Population ONE” is great, for those of us who don’t really like “battle Royale” style shooters, this will be your go to game.\n\nThis game has so many multiplayer modes that were all familiar with (eg: gun game, TDM, death match, Domination, bomb defusal, escort etc...) and this is apparently only the beginning.\n\nI’ve read a lot of negative reviews of people crying about this game missing this or that. First of all let’s put things into context, this is a multiplayer VR FPS running on essentially a mobile phone, and what this small dev team was able to accomplish is amazing.\n\nThe number of modes, maps, guns and graphics detail they were to put into this game without it melting the oculus quest headset is impressive. Compare this to onward, which looked like an N64 game with death animations from goldeneye and had a giant dev studio backing it, filled with glitches and bugs upon release.\n\nThat being said, you guys need to realize the insane value you’re getting for under $25. Don’t listen to people unfairly judging this game against other shooters which running on PC hardware or consoles that have vastly more horsepower, obviously some things need to be scaled down to work on a standalone VR headset because of hardware limitations. \n\nBOTTOM LINE: If you wanted a faster paced, fun, feature rich online multiplayer shooter that strikes the perfect balance between realistic and “run and gun” this is the game to get. For those of you who don’t like the slow gameplay of Onward and like something closer in pace to Call Of Duty, this is it.",
