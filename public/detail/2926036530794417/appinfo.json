As a result, we’re making some small but important quality of life updates to ecosphere!\n\nWhat’s New?\n\nWe’ve improved the start onboarding process and refined the UI for the main globe menu and each location. We’ve also reduced the loading time, so it’s easier to travel around the app.\n\n\n\nWe’ve added error messages (woohoo!) so you know when things aren’t working as they should. We’ve also introduced support for our alpha, beta and showcase release channels.\n\nBug Fixes?\n\nA few of you noticed that the delete episode confirmation box stayed open when changing between episodes, so we’ve solved that bug.\n\n\n\nAs always, we love hearing from you and we’re dedicated to improving your experience. Keep talking to us!",

							"body_text": "We’re excited to share what we’re doing with the ecosphere app in this update, and our long term vision for the series! Adding new content allows us to extend the current episodes with the new journeys into Kenya, Borneo and Raja Ampat, as seen on Oculus TV. This means that new ‘Journeys’ DLC will be available for each location.\n\n\n\nOur ‘Journeys’ update is the first step on a longer application roadmap. In future updates the player will expand so you can explore the gallery, choose video quality, watch behind the scenes footage and explore 3D environments in more detail. Our long term hope is that as we add new locations to the series, there will be this incredible library of secondary content you can dive into and explore.\n\n\n\nWe want to make ecosphere a place where you can immerse yourself in diverse stories of the natural world and its people. Very soon we hope to expand on the storytelling experience with new features like hand and gesture interactions, shared experience, and interactive video and 3D.\n\n\n\nWe couldn’t be more grateful for your support of the first release, and are proud to push content and DLC updates to let you go deeper into the episodes.\n\nFind and follow PHORIA on your favourite social media platform to get updates and early access to our new creations!",
