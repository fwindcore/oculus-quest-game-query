As a result, we’re making some small but important quality of life updates to ecosphere!\n\nWhat’s New?\n\nWe’ve improved the start onboarding process and refined the UI for the main globe menu and each location. We’ve also reduced the loading time, so it’s easier to travel around the app.\n\n\n\nWe’ve added error messages (woohoo!) so you know when things aren’t working as they should. We’ve also introduced support for our alpha, beta and showcase release channels.\n\nBug Fixes?\n\nA few of you noticed that the delete episode confirmation box stayed open when changing between episodes, so we’ve solved that bug.\n\n\n\nAs always, we love hearing from you and we’re dedicated to improving your experience. Keep talking to us!",

							"body_text": "We’re excited to share what we’re doing with the ecosphere app in this update, and our long term vision for the series! Adding new content allows us to extend the current episodes with the new journeys into Kenya, Borneo and Raja Ampat, as seen on Oculus TV. This means that new ‘Journeys’ DLC will be available for each location.\n\n\n\nOur ‘Journeys’ update is the first step on a longer application roadmap. In future updates the player will expand so you can explore the gallery, choose video quality, watch behind the scenes footage and explore 3D environments in more detail. Our long term hope is that as we add new locations to the series, there will be this incredible library of secondary content you can dive into and explore.\n\n\n\nWe want to make ecosphere a place where you can immerse yourself in diverse stories of the natural world and its people. Very soon we hope to expand on the storytelling experience with new features like hand and gesture interactions, shared experience, and interactive video and 3D.\n\n\n\nWe couldn’t be more grateful for your support of the first release, and are proud to push content and DLC updates to let you go deeper into the episodes.\n\nFind and follow PHORIA on your favourite social media platform to get updates and early access to our new creations!",

							"reviewDescription": "People will tell you that there are a lot of other places and apps by which to watch similar animal wildlife/conservation content, and they are right, but I have rarely found anything of the same quality. The picture quality is great, and it feels much more immersive than other similar content even though it's video and not actual a VR environment. It doesn't FEEL like a video, the way a lot of similar video on YouTube does. It's presented well to feel like you are in big locations and up close with the animals. And again, better picture quality than anything through the YouTube app. \nI would like to see a wider diversity of content and locations in this app. The choosing of your destination from a GLOBE implies that there are a lot of places to see, but, thus far there's three. I mean, we have the whole planet and we're only learning about animals in three places? I feel like some animals are getting left out. \nHowever, it is a dope, free app that allows you to watch free 180 VR video about different ecosystems around the world. Free immersive video downloads in good quality featuring wild life conservation and different ecosystems. Educational. Totally worth a look. It's got monkeys and baby elephants. What more do you need? \nCheck out my review here: https://youtu.be/WeA65Vp6Bfk\nThanks for watching StoneToaster Gaming!",
