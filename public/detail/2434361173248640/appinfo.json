We have enabled the newly supported 90Hz mode for a smoother experience. We enabled Phase Link for reduced latency. We now do realtime shadows inside the cockpit and we bumped up the Level of Detail to the same levels of the Rift version of End Space. This is as close to the graphics from the Rift version as we could manage inside this amazing standalone headset.\n\nRecently we have received a lot of feedback about how you control your ship not being optimal for a lot of new pilots. In this update we have changed the default control scheme to use the Thumbsticks on the Quest controllers for flight movement while aiming with the Right Touch controller to use your ships guns. We also swapped the Weapon Switch buttons from the Right Controller to the Left controller with the Brake/Boost buttons. This allows boosting and braking while flying in a more intuitive way.\nIn addition by disabling Gaze to Aim and enabling Virtual Joystick now allows two handed control. Your secondary hand aims the turret while the primary hand controls your Minos Spacefighter.\n\nAnother big change is we now use a new input curve on the Touch thumbsticks to more closely resemble those found on other Bluetooth gamepads. As a result the turning rate between touch and gamepad is much more consistent. And swapping between gamepads and Touch controllers is now more reliable too. If you are using the virtual joystick mode to control the ship, there is now an option to hold the controller at a negative angle as the resting angle which might be more comfortable for pilots.\n\nPlease come by our discord channel and let us know what you think about End Space and what you would like to see next.\n\nWishing everyone a happy and safe holiday season!\n\nJustin Wasilenko\n\nEnd Space 1.0.6.1 Update Changelog\n- Oculus System version 23 or greater is required to use these new features.
