							"reviewDescription": "From Dadspoker:\n\n1) Bonus and Awards for high hands should be paid directly to the players account! The player should not have to navigate discord and take a picture. royal flush should pay the player in game. \n\nI recently has a Royal flush and was unable to get a picture. I was told about discord after.\n\n2) No game tutorial. It took me days of questions and reading online about the functions of betting a hand. \n\n3. Kids should be in a separate area all together. Make a teaching table were all the cards are up and it has the ranking of hands in the corner for the that lights up what is happening. \n\n4. Levels 1-4 should not be able to play with levels 5 and up! \n\n5. Tournaments need a live moderator tournament director to combine tables in a more timely manner. \n\n6. Tournament buy in and chips supplied are off by large amounts and payouts of those tournaments are very strange. 100 people buy in 10000 and they only pay 250000 for top player and only supply 3000 in chips to start. Rounds are so fast it is a joke. No serious player can rely on skill. It is very luck based. \n\n7. Buy the button is needed! Players can join a table and start behind the dealer button. They dont have to pay a blind to see there first couple hands. So free hands for players causes to cheapen the game for the players that have waited and paid for the position . \n\n8. You need to program it to double the bet automatically if someone raises. \n\n9. Players must buy in for the same amount if they leave a table and come back to that same limit game. You should not be able to bank money and play on the same table to just took $200k off of and come back to buy in for only 50k. Very unfair. \n\n10. One thousand a day should just add in to your account. So when you skip a couple days you have a couple K to play with. \n\n11. Players with higher levels should get more that 1k a day if they go broke. Enough to get pasted the kids tables. \n\n12. Everyone should be able to see the tournament board with out having to turn around. \n\n13. The buy in to the games and the big and small blind are not correct. The blinds should stay the same and the buy in max needs to be increased by 30 percent. The least buy in amount need to stay the same. \n\n14. Give your friend chips! You should be able to send your friend, wife, partner or kids your chips. \n\n15. Show all players cards that are in the hand! Even if a player loses or fold they deserve to see every exposed card. This is a huge mistake that needs to be fixed. Information is key and seeing all the players cards, this shows players how others player play and what they bet on. \n\n16. Hand history for the last couple hands. What won and who won. \n\n17. Players should get points for hours of play, hands played and not just winning hands won. This seems to be very unfair that you only move up levels if you win . \n\n18. Invite only games for friend and family to play together. \n\n19. Hats!!\n\n20. Workshops with famous players that teach strategy. \n\nThose are 20 things that I suggest to be changed or fixed. I am 95 percent sure this will fix your issues and increase buy ins and player’s happiness. (Well as happy as a poker player will ever be)",
