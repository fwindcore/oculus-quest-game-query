			"display_long_description": "Richie's Plank Experience was designed to invoke the strongest possible emotions in the shortest possible time. Entertain your friends and family as they walk the plank, 80 stories high. Knees week, palms sweaty. \n\nIf that doesn't get them, the nightmare mode, sky writing or flying in the three hero academy missions will.\n\nIf you're expecting a 2 hour game for yourself, this probably isn't for you. Please don't buy it! If you plan to entertain your friends and family this is the one for you. Especially if you take it up a notch and optionally setup a real plank. Use world's first system to clone real-world objects into the VR world. Any width, any length.\n\nSAFETY NOTICE\nAvoid injury by ensuring your guests follow the these guidelines.\n1. Don't push people in VR. This breaks immersion and damages trust with them and others waiting for their turn.\n2. Instruct players to step off the plank. Strictly no jumping. \n3. Use two spotters who are ready to catch players if they fall.\n\n",

While the update was intended for Quest 2, the artist and developer managed to squeeze a lot of them into Quest 1 as well.\n\n\n\n\nVISUAL\n\n- Higher resolution (Quest 2 only)\n- Bigger city. 20 new buildings.\n- 4k textures for Roads and footpaths.\n- Linear color space for higher contrast shadows.\n- More clouds. (Quest 2 only for now)\n- Photo-sourced terrain texture.\n- Fake bloom directional light. (Gives a slight sun-burned glow to everything)\n- Replaced low poly tree with a high poly statue for nice lighting.\n- Gravity Radio billboard.\n- Colorfull flags on ground floor.\n- Adjusted aircon vent vapor intensity.\n- Bigger god ray on ground floor.\n- More god ray particles.\n- Higher res cars.\n- More reflections on more buildings.\n- Improved building shader with stronger reflections and even more performance.\n- Photo-real texture for roads.\n- Fixed reflection bug in elevator. (not sure how)\n- Added more shadow trickery to break up bright areas.\n- Used more use of vertex colors for more pops of color.\n- Increased saturation of hot air balloon color.\n- Remastered aircon blades.\n- New texture for rooftop details.\n- Remastered building to the left of the plank.\n- Adjusted position of wind generators.\n- Gravity Signs.\n- Remastered park texture.\n- Smaller birds. (They were too big)\n\nSOUND\n\n- Increased helicoptor volume distance.\n\nUI\n- Rearranged UI text to be a bit more neater\n\nUX\n- Recentering isn't advised. Use plank setup!\n- Recentering message won't happen when you take the headset off anymore. This may lead to drift in the plank position sometimes. We are keeping an eye on this.",

I was mildly underwhelmed at first when undergoing the main plank experience. However, there's more than just a plank. There's the sky brush, which lets you fly throughout the city leaving a trail of paint to make art, and my personal favorite, the hero academy. The experiences from the hero academy are fun and so surreal; they should just change the name of the game to Richie's Hero Academy Experience!\n\nAs you can probably tell now from reading this review, my expectations were blown out of the water. My family also really enjoyed it as well, and it is now their favorite VR game (Although it's not my favorite). This proves that this game is not overrated, and deserves to be in every VR user's library.",
