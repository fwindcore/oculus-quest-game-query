The meadow is pretty boring. It would be nice if we could hear the ocean more or hear wind blowing through the mountains. Adding the noise of the fire crackling and popping would also be nice. Being able to listen to soft music outside while enjoying the view would be good. The ability to add rain or a thunder storm to the meadow would make it more relaxing/interesting to me.  More content to the tv or the ability to sync with Netflix or prime would be great! Adding different living environments would also be nice but I know I'm getting carried away.  Also it is the end of January and time to take down the Christmas tree I think. Overall and great app with some really nice features.",
