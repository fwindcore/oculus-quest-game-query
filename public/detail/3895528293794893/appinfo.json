I'd love to see captions on that in-VR television.  Most PBS material is already captioned so the caption tracks are available, so they just need to be decoded as overlaid text.  Hopefully this is an easy modification -- my rating will be upgraded to 5 stars when this happens.\n\nAlso older relatives (major target market) tend to be deafened to some extents, so the Closed Captions will be useful to them too.  A toggleable \"CC\" icon next to the volume icon, to turn on/off closed captions.",
