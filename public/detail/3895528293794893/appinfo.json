Alcove is a fully immersive experience with everything you can imagine - yoga, travel, music, creative spaces, playing games...... and it's all in my own home that I can customize (including the views - prefer the ocean view).   And, I don't have to experience it alone.  I invited my brother into my house for a game of chess and my dad in a couple of times to show him some of the videos (he liked the underwater exploration).  There has been new content/experiences added since I downloaded Alcove… so please keep the updates coming! Thanks!",
