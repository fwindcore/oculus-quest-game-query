I agree with some of the other reviews, that more sound effects would be great for the scenery and the fire. Maybe also have it tied to the time zone so that when I put it on at night it's dark outside?\n\nWhat I would really love is a game like this where I can actually design and build my own dream house and walk around inside it. Maybe something that has lots of rooms and modules you can select and adapt to build your own place. But really, I would live in the Alcove house if I could.",
