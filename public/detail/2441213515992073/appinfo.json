Unique and a lot of fun. \nWhat doesn’t work. Resolution is pretty bad, just like in the first one. Which is pretty disappointing cause I’m playing on the Quest 2. \nHow you interact with the environment is terrible and does not help immersion. Very glitchy, rendering environments while I’m walking through them. \nLevel design is boring, just like in the first game, the devs have no love (more likely budget) for exploration. There’s many path-looking things that look like they might lead to a different section of the map but are always deadends. There’s nothing to explore, so you just press on. Also on that note, the narrator, who talks way too often, only gives you like 10 seconds to figure out what to do before he tells you, leaving nothing to figure out or explore.\nSomethings don’t have sound bites wen they should. Like the stairs that roll out before you, really cool, but they make zero noise, just another thing that breaks immersion. \nDon’t know how long it is but the last one was pretty short, expecting the same thing\n\nMan if people could comment on my review I would be getting RAILED by everyone. Lol but the truth is, VR players hate to write bad comments about games and I don’t know why that is. Yes, we are still at the beginning of VR and things aren’t going to be perfect. But telling the devs the things that don’t work is the only way things improve. \nThis game is fun, maybe worth the 25, not sure though. It lacks in a lot of areas",
