							"reviewDescription": "The game itself is brilliant. Some of the levels had my hands sweating with concentration and fear of falling into the abyss. Plenty of invention in the game from evil floating fish to walls of lasers which will kill you, plus the occasional puzzle. One of my best moments in VR is when I figured out how to climb to the top of a level to reach a firefly which I had genuinely thought was impossible.\n\nHowever, the thing that really frustrated is that I've found myself playing the same levels almost continuously. I got caught in one loop where I'd play the levels to the end and keep going back to the first one of the loop. After emailing the devs it was explained that you could get out of the loop by not completing one of the levels- though your natural inclination is to progress by finishing it - but by going through a door within the level.\n\nJust as frustrating is that in Firefly Alley there are a number of doors. And if you go through one you've already gone through - which might have been days ago - you have no option but to play the whole level again. If you  wander in the wrong door there should be a way you can just back out without going through the level you've already completed. \n\nAs much as I love the game I keep needlessly repeating levels and it's getting to seriously detract from what would otherwise be a five-star game.\n\nUPDATE: Received email from devs saying that a future update which will allow you to leave levels you've already completed. And visual cues to tell which is the next door to go through. When then happens it will easily be one of the best games on the Quest.",
