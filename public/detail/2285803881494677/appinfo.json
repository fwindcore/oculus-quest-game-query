Ive been wanting a realistic shooting range game since I saw a youtube review for a different game in this vein. But I cant afford a few thousand dollars in PC upgrades and VR kits, so when I saw this game and how much the quest 2 cost, I had to buy them both. Whether you have 10 minutes to play a few rounds of sideshow, or want to spend hours setting up custom shooting ranges in sandbox, trying out every single weapon in game this game has it all. Two suggestions if the devs are reading, please let me take the guns Ive bought with me into sandbox, sometimes I want to try out different combinations of scopes and attachments without a time restraint. And secondly, I absolutely loved the little hidden easter egg hunt you put in, I would love if you did that again.",
