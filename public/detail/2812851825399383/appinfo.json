							"reviewDescription": "Please note that this is a visual novel (VN) and mainly consists of clicking through dialogue and there is no gameplay. I didn’t realize this fact and was fairly disappointed and would’ve given this game one star if it weren’t for the ending. At first it’s pretty boring as you’re simply clicking through an anime in VR. What saves this game is the ending (the true ending) which is extremely beautiful and gives you a sense of accomplishment. See more below to help you with the game (may contain spoilers).\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nA couple of things to help you out:\n1. Always choose the left option to get through all the subchapters for the true ending. Once you choose left, you will always have the option to go back to the ‘right’ choice. I made the mistake of choosing right in the first choice and had to go back later on.\n2. You have to play this game twice. The first time sets the stage but leaves many questions unanswered. The second time will answer everything and you will get the true ending. There are a lot of repeats but you can quickly click the dialogue away or use the skip feature. But there is new information intertwined in each ‘Re:chapter’ (the second play-through).\n3. Only after going through the first chapters (aka chapters), the second chapters (aka Re:chapters) and the left choices (aka subchapters) will you be able to unlock the true ending.\n\nSUPER SPOILER BELOW:\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nWithout going into too much detail and ruining the ending, I wanted to point out that the main story is about suicide which may make some uncomfortable.\n\n\n\nOverall I feel it’s worth it to try as long as you know what you’re getting into since the idea is quite novel and the ending is fantastic. I might even think about getting the sequel, Altdeus: beyond chronos, which looks more interactive. This is quite a surprise since after playing this game for a few hours I really didn’t think it was worth it but I was convinced by the end.",
