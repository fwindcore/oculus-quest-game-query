							"reviewDescription": "I saw people play this game on YouTube, and it looked like a dream. Once I got the game on my Quest 2, it did not at all disappoint. \n\nYou start off with two weapons, and you have to choose a difficulty and slice, block, and dodge your way through a gauntlet of enemies that progressively become more difficult, as well as more smart. Along the way you will have to choose upgrades in the form of crushing crystals, which can give you a leg up against the enemies. The enemies and level placements are procedurly generated, making each run feel fresh. Gameplay is superb... but what about the graphics?\n\nThe graphics look... pretty good overall. Definatly great for the quest. The lighting and vibrancy looks GEORGIOUS on the system, and you can tell they put effort in porting this game. The models of yourself and the enemies look amazing, and my only gripe is the low resolution on the textures on the ground, surrounding landscape, and the red crystal at the end of each level is pretty low res, but other than that it looks great, especially since you get the PC version included if you want to hook up your quest to your PC via link or virtual desktop (im sure its great I've yet to try XD) \n\nBut there's one more thing about this game i have yet to touch on...\n\nTHE FITNESS\n\nOooh my gosh this game is an amazing workout.  When you get into the \"Challenging\" difficulty and above, this game will destroy you if you actually try XD. In 30 minutes, I burned over 220 calories, and im only 110 pounds! The best part is that it's such a fun game, you don't even realize that your working out, so it doesn't feel tedious... however the face pad may be completely drenched in sweat when your done, so either sanitize it after or buy the VR cover facial interface. \n\nOverall, so far this is one of if not my favorite game on quest. HIGHLY reccomend!",
