This isn't a \"chip away at a health bar\" type fighting game, but a honest boxing sim. Three of my many favorite points of this game are:\n\nPROS\n\n- Weight class system. You use the heavy bag to determine your weight class. Your damage multiplayer on punches are based on this mechanic and it is a fantastic way to make it fun regardless of your physique.\n\n- physics. The physics are dialed in spot on. Before you even get in a fight the speed bag, focus bag, and heavy bag demonstrate this very well.\n\n- Opponent. The opponent's reactions, movements, and battle damage he takes are all realistic.\n\n\nI want to be honest with this review, so there has to be a cons section. In reality I haven't found many in my few hours of playing it, so these will seem nit-picky:\n\nCONS\n\n -Multiplayer. Multiplayer doesn't exist. I think it would be a fun addition, but honestly I think the amount of effort they put into this game was better spent on how spot on they got the single player rather than playing whack-a-mole chasing down all the headaches that would come with a multiplayer roll out. Maybe now that they made this game and are working on a sequel, they have the groundwork payed out for a future multiplayer stand alone game.\n\n- Gloves. Again, super nit-picky, but I would like to see some variation on glove design. I am a huge fan of compact, blocky Mexican style gloves like anything made by Cleto Reyes and I my go to gloves vary from the 12-14 oz range. As someone who boxes welterweight, it is a bit disconcerting seeing myself holding these box honking 16oz gloves. It is a very minimal detail which I am sure has a lot to do with licensing, but it does throw off my visibility around my gloves by a slight amount.\n\nOF NOTE FOR PEOPLE LOOKING TO PURCHASE THIS GAME:\n\nHere are few things that might or might not appeal to you.\n\n- This is not a \"fighting game\". If you want big flashy knockouts every time you land a combo or unrealistic fighting moves, this isn't the game for you. The point of this sim is authenticity, so even if you open up with your hardest hits and even score a knockdown you might find yourself genuinely winded and still get the tar knocked out of you. Just like if you were really boxing. Even if you land your hardest hits, where you land them is important. A conservative cross to the jaw is far more damaging than a full power jab to the forehead. HOWEVER, neither are particularly important if you don't score at least a knockdown. Sometimes you are better off saving your energy and going light. Boxing is often won on points, not flashy knockouts. The great this about this game is that it supports all styles of boxing, so do what works best for you.\n\n- This game is a serious cardio workout. I am not talking about a VR \"workout\" like those reviewers that claim that beat saber is good cardio workout. This is common sense to anyone who has boxed before, but take it easy as you warm up, take a break when you need it, and drink water. You will get dehydrated otherwise. I also recommend a sweat towel, but that's just me.\n\nFINAL NOTES\n\nThis game does the one thing that I was so scared it wouldn't. As a natural Southpaw, I was so afraid this game and it's mechanics would fall apart for anyone who isn't orthodox. I was afraid the AI wouldn't know how to respond to me like so many other VR games (looking especially hard at you, shooting sims). I was able to box comfortably and everything went great. Great game.
