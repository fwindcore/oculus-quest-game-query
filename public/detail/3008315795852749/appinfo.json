Use the new bHaptics option on the main menu to pair the hardware with the Quest. You'll need to allow TotF permission to access Bluetooth (shown as location permissions).\n* Added support for Quest mixed reality capture.\n* Added multiplier reset button to the Configuration quick-view panel to the right of the main menu. This button will only appear when you have the \"Automatic Force Adjustment\" enabled, and will let you quickly reset your multiplier if you feel it is stuck too low or if you are handing off the headset to another player.\n* When the AI is lightly dizzed, it will only throw with its typical punch output when cornered. Previously, the AI would change from its lower punch output when significantly dizzy directly to its high punch output from being cornered. Switching to normal punch output under light dizziness helps the transition between the two.",

We are excited to share that Oculus is now introducing this functionality with Oculus Move. This is a new platform feature that helps you track calories burned and physically active minutes as you play any game or app, including The Thrill of the Fight. The Oculus team has begun a gradual rollout today, so some Quest and Quest 2 users will already have access! Check your library for the Oculus Move app.",

Add body shots KO.\n3. Add women devision.\n4. Add weight classes, show belts.....\n5. Add fighters presentation before the fight to make it sound real.\n6. Add character customization, choice of country and show the flags at the corners.\n7. Add spectator mode, like other players come online and watch the fight and can interact and comment, it makes it more real and takes the game to next level\n8. Add multilayer, leagues and fight for the belts.\n9. Add add-ons to buy.\n\nI guarantee you if you create such a game, it will sell like ice-cream even if it's 30 or 40 usd.\n\nI hope you take some of my suggestions into consideration...thank you 🙏🏻👊🏻👊🏻👊🏻",
