Every run will have you play in a new procedurally generated layout, with random positions for rooms, corridors, items and hazards, and different emergent situations. You’ll never quite know what’s behind the next door.\n\nSURVIVE: \nUse your own hands to interact with the environment. Open doors, drawers and lockers and rummage through their contents. Collect basic resources, and craft weapons and equipment to deal with both enemies and hazards.\n\nFIGHT: \nCrouch behind cover and shoot at enemies with your crossbow, or set a trap for them to walk into. But remember: ammo is scarce!",

In this game you’re a cosmonaut trapped aboard a dying spaceship filled with horrors and your mission is to get back to earth. \n\nThe tense, horror atmosphere is amazing, and the gameplay is both engaging and addictive. The visuals are decent, and I love the retro look that the spaceship has which reminds me of a sci fi program from the 60s/70s.\n\nAmmo is scarce so in addition to weapons, grenades and traps, you will need to hide, run and throw things to distract enemies long enough to get by. The game is well balanced, you always feel like the odds are stacked against you as you scavenge items from the ship to stay alive, but it never gets impossibly difficult or unfair. \n\nTechnically you could complete all objectives on the ship in about 2 hours but it’s very unlikely you will do this on your first go. Realistically you are looking at a few attempts. It took me about 4-5 hours to get through one playthrough and even then there’s a ton of replay value here as the environments are procedurally generated so each time you play, the ship layout and monster/item placement changes up. There are also modifiers you can turn on which change the gameplay (e.g. more monsters, no guns).\n\nFor me, this is a must have title and for $15 is worth every cent.",
