							"body_text": "Today’s patch is officially live, which means the 3-year anniversary scavenger hunt is officially underway. Visit the anniversary NPC next to the bulletin board near the Player House in-game to pick up the first quest. Complete the scavenger hunt to earn a Penguin Transmog set, perfect for enjoying the last month of winter in-game.\n\n\n\nWe will also be giving away a 3-year anniversary cake (Player House furniture) and cape. Visit the Rewards NPC near the Critter Capture shop to pick up both items.\n\nIt’s been a big year of growth at OrbusVR. Our community progressively grew over the course of the year, and consequently racked up some impressive stats. In just the past year, the community killed almost 2x as many monsters as in the first two years combined; made almost 3x as many characters; collected more than 4x as much loot and ran 4x as many dungeons.\n\nAs the Quest 2 helps to make VR more mainstream, we look forward to seeing even more players join the community!\n\nAnd speaking of Quest 2, our updates for that are officially live, too. With this change, Quest 2 users will now be able to see toolbelt items and mounts on other players. You can also say goodbye to two left hands as other players should now display with both a left and a right hand. The following bug fixes/quality of live improvements are also now available:\n\n- A new, safer way to delete characters to help reduce chances of any accidental character deletions. Now when you select “Delete” on the character menu, you will have to press and hold the Confirm button. Your controller should vibrate as you wait for the red dial to fill up, at which point your character will officially be deleted.\n\n- A new lock button for your inventory. With this new feature you can prevent accidental deletions of special items when you’re cleaning out your inventory. Simply select the item in your inventory and select the “Lock” button below. You can still equip locked items, but in order to break them down and remove them from your inventory, you will need to first unlock them.\n\n- A check for new Fellowship members. Now when inviting members to join your fellowship, the game will perform a check to ensure they aren't already a member of another Fellowship.\n\n- A fix for the Scoundrel deck relocation anchor getting reset when zoning.",

Here’s a quick look at what you have to look forward to in the next couple months in Orbus.\n\n3-Year Anniversary Event\nOrbusVR is officially 3! To celebrate, we are doing an in-game scavenger hunt. The hunt will launch Tuesday, Feb. 2 and will run through Tuesday, March 2.\n\nWe’ll have a couple of giveaways, as well as a fun prize for completing the scavenger hunt. We’ll also be doing an in-game meet-up with the Devs Wednesday, Feb. 3 from 6 - 7 PM CST. More details to come next week!\n\nQuest 2 Improvements\nBeta testing for Quest 2 updates is complete and will roll out to the entire community in the next patch. With this change, Quest 2 users will now be able to see toolbelt items and mounts on other players. You can also say goodbye to two left hands as other players should now display with both a left and a right hand. A big thank you to those members of the community who helped us with beta testing these changes!\n\nSpring Festival\nThe spring festival will be returning to game on Tuesday, March 2—so if you’re getting tired of winter terrain, know that greener pastures are on the horizon! As always, we’ll have a few new rewards to hand out.\n\nHard Mode Citadel Raid\nToward the end of February/beginning of March we plan on releasing the hard mode version of the Citadel Raid, which will feature more challenging versions of the current raid’s boss fights, as well as new rewards.\n\nBug Fixes and Quality of Life Improvements\nThis year we are doubling down on looking into some of the top-reported bugs. With the Anniversary patch in a week and a half, we'll be implementing a couple of new changes, including:\n\n- a new, safer way to delete characters to help reduce chances of any accidental character deletions\n- a new lock button for your inventory that allows you to lock items in your inventory. With this new feature you won't be able to break down that item unless you manually unlock it\n- a check for new Fellowship members that first ensures they aren't already a member of another Fellowship\n- a fix for the Scoundrel deck relocation anchor getting rest when zoning\n\nLook for another post in the coming weeks with more details on the next patch!",

							"reviewDescription": "I'll start by saying that I really do like this game. With that said, I think there are a few things worth getting out of the way so that you can make a good purchasing decision. This is not your normal run-of-the-mill MMO. If you're hoping for WOW in VR, then this isn't that. It is a great MMO that requires you to think, research, and coordinate with others. However, it doesn't hold your hand very much, and it requires you to learn from others and from content that you'll find online. The tutorial is very basic and doesn't cover everything. You'll need to reach out to other players so that you can learn about how to play the game and where to go. Expect that you'll need to watch videos and read guides in order to figure out what you need to do. This is not the sort of game that you can just jump into solo and then expect that everything will work out. With that out of the way, there is a lot to like about Orbus. It includes all of the staples that you'd expect from a full MMO:\n\n- Dungeons\n- Raids\n- Open-world Bosses\n- Open-world PVP\n- Battleground PVP\n- Player Housing\n- Progression\n- Loot collection\n- Crafting\n- Mounts\n\nI'd recommend this game to anyone that is ready to put in a little work to get the most out of it. However if you're only used to modern hold-your-hand MMO's or mobile MMO's, then this is not similar. You have to really explore and navigate to find your objectives. The classes are all skill-based and you'll need to learn to swing/shoot your weapon accurately. If you don't like to talk to other people, or if you don't speak English, then don't buy this game. Working and talking with others isn't really optional if you want to figure things out. It may feel like I'm being negative, but what I'm trying to do is to make sure that if you buy this, you do it with the right expectations and for the right reasons. If you are looking for a deep experience on your Quest, then this game has that in spades. It's an amazing game for the right kind of gamer.",
