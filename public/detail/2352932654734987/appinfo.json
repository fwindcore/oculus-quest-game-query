Leaving the Hard Mode Raid will place you back inside Highsteppe.\n\nThe Beta will last for 2 weeks, which should give the Dev team enough time to work out any bugs, uncover any potential flaws in the fights, and make sure the balance is just the right amount of challenge: not too easy, but not impossible to defeat. To make testing the mechanics easier for the Beta, we have removed all the trash spawns, as well as the boss kill requirements to spawn the next boss in line. During the Beta, no armor, weapons, or rewards will drop.\n\nThe official Hard Mode Citadel Raid will launch on Tuesday, May 11.\n\nThis update also includes a very large fix for the ongoing invisible players/mob issues, which may have widespread repercussions on other issues affecting the game. To report any new issues or offer feedback on the Hard Mode Raid, please visit the OrbusVR Community Forums at community.orbusvr.com.",

							"body_text": "The April 6th patch featuring the Highsteppe Farms and Bard mechanic fixes is now live. The patch features two new farms, one in each direction off Trader’s Road, and the return of sheep to the world of Orbus. Please be kind to our new four legged friends, as they die easily and are hard for the farmers to replace.\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to the new overworld farms, you’ll also find a new dock and fishing hut at the lake next to the Kingsport Graveyard.\n\n\n\nWe’ll be introducing some side quests featuring the farms in future updates.\n\nThis patch also includes some updates and fixes for the Bard class. (For a full list of fixes, please visit the Community Forums.) While some of the fixes for the Bard class were closer to a balance pass than true mechanic fixes, we wanted to get the class closer to its intended state before we start looking at the overall healer/tank/support balance pass. We will begin collecting data on all the classes for this upcoming balance pass in the coming weeks, and will work closely with the community as we did on the DPS balance pass.\n\n",

The biggest tip I can give,  is if you're stuck on the initial part,  just say out loud your new and looking for help or answers to questions near any group of players.  90% of the time someone  will stop and assist.",
