Bipedal beasts of great strength and size, they left their hillside caves at the first snow to wreak havoc on the villages of Patreayl. Isolated clans came together to beat the strange creatures back into the hills every year and afterward celebrate their victory. Thus, the Festival of Strangers was born.\n\n\n\nWe have officially switched the terrain over to the winter season and rolled out the festival. To pick up all the relevant mission and quests, you will need to visit:\n\n- Festival NPC outside the gates of Highsteppe - main Heart of the Strangers questline\n- Festival Farmer outside the Critter Capture shop - Floating lights side quest\n- Pierre Cenn inside the Critter Capture shop - Snowman Critter Capture mission\n\n\n\nThis year’s rewards include:\n\n- Snowman Transmog set\n- Fireplace (Player House furniture)\n- Snowshoes mount\n- Festival of Strangers 2020 cape\n- 2020 Snowman pet\n\nThe Furniture Shop in Highsteppe will also have several winter festival-themed items for sale again. The Snowman furniture blueprints will also be available again as a rare drop off the wild snowmen bouncing around the overworld.\n\nFor those who remember last year’s quests, you’ll know that completing the questline is much easier with friends, so don’t be a stranger in game and ask somebody if they want to play!", "tile_landscape_image": {"uri": "https://scontent.oculuscdn.com/v/t64.5771-25/39031556_4133402880020595_924626728830368973_n.png?_nc_cat=103&ccb=2&_nc_sid=79b88e&_nc_ohc=-Apd_qDMreYAX8y7Vqh&_nc_ht=scontent.oculuscdn.com&oh=ce51530f2955681c8d3e5c275a0b104d&oe=601331AF"}}, {"id": "429358464886041", "title": "Now Live: Finalized Citadel Raid!", "created_time": 1608055569, "body_text": "The finalized Citadel Raid is now live! You can still join the Raid using the Raid queue option in the Social tab of the Player Menu, but if you have a full party and want to walk through the Citadel doors together, use the secret tunnel at the back of the Dragon Shoppe. (As it is a secret tunnel, it may not immediately be obvious to see, but look a little harder. It's there.) Whichever option you choose, be sure to speak with Helga first so you can pick up the Raid quest.\n\nLoot\n\nNow that the beta test is complete, you will have the chance to earn new weapons and armor through the raid. These armor and weapon sets will be +4, with a chance at +5 legendary weapons. Each of the legendary weapons have been imbued with some magick from the Essence that Sephotep has managed to steal from Taella Bruha, which can be seen coursing throughout the weapon as a green glowing effect.\n\nEach Raid boss offers a chance to earn different gear, with Napur (Crystal boss 1) dropping Shoulder and Gloves, Brynjua (Chain boss 2) Helms, Geruvi (Gear boss 3) Chests, and Enraged Sephotep (Boss 4) weapons and a cape, as well as a small chance at a \"Weak Sephotep Windup Pet.\" Along with these drops you also can receive 2 new dyes from any of the bosses.\n\nWe have also added Achievements for defeating each of the bosses, as well as an Achievement for completing the Raid questline.\n\nRaid trash mobs have also been added back in.\n\nOur Dev team will keep monitoring balancing feedback in the coming weeks, so if you have any feedback you would like to offer, visit community.orbusvr.com to let us know your thoughts!\n\nAdditional Notes\n\n- Winter Fest also dropped today! Look for a dedicated post on the festival coming very soon.\n- We are working to track down a bug that has appeared recently causing some players and monsters to appear as \"invisible\" to certain players.\n- We are also working on an update to take advantage of improved Quest 2 graphics, and are hoping to release that before the end of the year.", "tile_landscape_image": {"uri": "https://scontent.oculuscdn.com/v/t64.5771-25/38974693_296334918487595_2924463524524270814_n.png?_nc_cat=101&ccb=2&_nc_sid=79b88e&_nc_ohc=RU9KW90SftoAX-JfrVQ&_nc_ht=scontent.oculuscdn.com&oh=8b71ddb2502152dd49c4f569a5088a69&oe=600FD297"}}]}, "iap_items_2": {"edges": [{"cursor": "AQHRaiE3h2ymcsgwVs9RzKnf88JG6P8aCNz-PPLddDFDYkYtQreb9DCNA9aLD75WimZIvd7pEWlucjQDpPqpZ0Yjog"}]}}, "externalReviewsForDisplay": {"nodes": []}, "externalReviewsComplete": {"count": 0}, "user_data_disclosure_translated": null, "__isItemWithComfortRating": "Application", "comfort_rating": "COMFORTABLE_FOR_SOME", "is_viewer_subscribed_coming_soon": false, "internet_connection": "REQUIRED", "internet_connection_name": "需要连接网络", "__isItemWithHmdPlatformInformaton": "Application", "supported_input_devices_list": [{"name": "Oculus Touch", "tag": "OCULUS_TOUCH"}], "canonicalName": "orbus-online-llc-orbusvr-android6d0f", "viewer_has_preorder": false, "purchase_alerts": [], "is_granted_on_hardware_registration": false, "current_trial_offer": null, "extra_buy_box_section": {"content": "Oculus 退款政策", "link_uri": "https://www.oculus.com/legal/quest-rift-content-refund-policy/"}, "is_viewer_entitled": false, "baseline_offer": {"price": {"offset_amount": "1999"}, "id": "527918914775620"}, "__isWishlistableItem": "Application", "entry": null, "is_demo_of": null, "appName": "OrbusVR: Reborn", "platformOffer": null, "is_giftable": true, "current_gift_offer": {"__typename": "AppStoreOffer", "id": "527918914775620"}, "externalReviews": {"count": 0}, "quality_rating_aggregate": 4.0870667793745, "support_website_url": "https://community.orbusvr.com/", "quality_ratings_by_viewer": [], "reviewInfo": {"count": 558, "orderings": [{"key": "top", "label": "最相关"}, {"key": "most_recent", "label": "从新到旧"}]}, "firstQualityRatings": {"count": 558, "page_info": {"end_cursor": "AQHRfDJnzT0SouABzrZePJgJKL6x0BZW9dX4XhBbmMNgY4McvryDdoui9Cx41uN-FgK4TGMlMTNpYU3m0wV_u9Qxiw", "start_cursor": "AQHRfDJnzT0SouABzrZePJgJKL6x0BZW9dX4XhBbmMNgY4McvryDdoui9Cx41uN-FgK4TGMlMTNpYU3m0wV_u9Qxiw"}, "edges": [{"node": {"id": "3272641502865128", "author": {"id": "720873361375301", "display_name": "Flickstiq", "profile_photo": {"uri": "https://scontent.oculuscdn.com/v/t64.5771-25/q92/c0.0.176.176a/s160x160/12449045_1588990364563592_6868489911394107392_n.jpg?_nc_cat=105&ccb=2&_nc_sid=79b88e&_nc_ohc=L4qNqUeThD4AX-PvL7V&_nc_ht=scontent.oculuscdn.com&tp=28&oh=8994ecf3490c02ed3e3a4bccaad2de35&oe=6010356A"}}, "score": 4, "reviewDescription": "I'll start by saying that I really do like this game. With that said, I think there are a few things worth getting out of the way so that you can make a good purchasing decision. This is not your normal run-of-the-mill MMO. If you're hoping for WOW in VR, then this isn't that. It is a great MMO that requires you to think, research, and coordinate with others. However, it doesn't hold your hand very much, and it requires you to learn from others and from content that you'll find online. The tutorial is very basic and doesn't cover everything. You'll need to reach out to other players so that you can learn about how to play the game and where to go. Expect that you'll need to watch videos and read guides in order to figure out what you need to do. This is not the sort of game that you can just jump into solo and then expect that everything will work out. With that out of the way, there is a lot to like about Orbus. It includes all of the staples that you'd expect from a full MMO:\n\n- Dungeons\n- Raids\n- Open-world Bosses\n- Open-world PVP\n- Battleground PVP\n- Player Housing\n- Progression\n- Loot collection\n- Crafting\n- Mounts\n\nI'd recommend this game to anyone that is ready to put in a little work to get the most out of it. However if you're only used to modern hold-your-hand MMO's or mobile MMO's, then this is not similar. You have to really explore and navigate to find your objectives. The classes are all skill-based and you'll need to learn to swing/shoot your weapon accurately. If you don't like to talk to other people, or if you don't speak English, then don't buy this game. Working and talking with others isn't really optional if you want to figure things out. It may feel like I'm being negative, but what I'm trying to do is to make sure that if you buy this, you do it with the right expectations and for the right reasons. If you are looking for a deep experience on your Quest, then this game has that in spades. It's an amazing game for the right kind of gamer.", "reviewTitle": "Very Good, but not for everybody", "review_helpful_count": 675, "review_rank_by_viewer": null, "date": 1604033383, "developerResponse": null}}]}, "can_viewer_review": false, "is_offer_region_restricted": false, "__isWithWebsitePageMeta": "Application", "website_page_meta": {"description": "OrbusVR: Reborn is the first MMORPG designed exclusively for room-scale virtual reality.
