							"reviewDescription": "Ok, we hit 3500, here goes nothing. Take a deep breath, this will take a while.\n\nFnaf 1: you don’t need the lights on to see Bonnie of Chica walk by. You can see Bonnie’s white feet and Chica’ arm. Remember, if they stop to look at you, shut the door right away. For foxy, you don’t need to keep the camera on him the whole game, remember that he doesn’t like being watched TOO much either. Just check him from time to time. For Freddy it’s the same thing, wait 5 laughs and shut the door. The cameras, in this game, cost absolutely no power. Use this to your advantage and try to be aware of all of them, this will give you the upper hand. Remember that most of the time, Bonnie and Chica will walk right past you. However, in rare cases, they will stop to look at you, watch them as they go by, keeping the light on them will cause them to look at you no matter what, so don’t do this.\n\nFnaf 2: easy enough, just play the same way you would on mobile, nothing really changes in the terms of gameplay. Throw the mask on when they are in the office, keep the music box winded up, and your good. You will occasionally hear a metallic sound down the hallway, don’t be alarmed if you do, it just means Foxy is there. Calmly flash the hallway until he leaves. Easy enough. Remember, when in doubt, put on the mask. It won’t hurt anything, and anyone in an attack position will be revealed.\n\nFnaf 3: On night 2 they start moving. Try to keep Springtrap in cameras 9-10. If you can’t find him, he may be in the vents. One more thing, keep the reboot all on and keep pressing the button so if something breaks it gets fixed quickly. You can only keep an eye on one of the monitors at once, either the vent or the map cameras. Remember that on the later nights, Springtrap will start out closer to you, start of with checking the closer cameras, than work your way up. Foxy may also appear in the side of the room, if you see him, do not look directly at him, just pretend he isn’t there. The lights will briefly flicker when he leaves. Also keep in mind that if a strange face appears right in front of the camera, (not Springtrap) switch to another immediately, this will prevent you from getting jump scared. \n\nParts and service: they are big, yes. I know it can be nerve racking, but just follow the instructions and you will be fine. (Keep an eye on foxy at all times) On Freddy’s parts in service, there is a twist. He will attack if you go to fast, and the items will fall out of your hands if you most them too fast. \n\nDark rooms: Plushtrap: listen for his footsteps. When in doubt, flash the light, but try not to do it too often.\nNightmare BB: same thing\nFuntime foxy: don’t go too fast, she relies on hearing you. Remember you are not the only person who cannot see... a zigzag path may be advised, but I personally don’t use it. It isn’t really reliable. While this may work, it is more risky. Just go straight, and then when she is right in front in you, back away/turn.\nPlush baby: always keep some power in you flashlight. Do little flashes at a time. If you ever hear her talk find her ASAP. They move pretty fast, and there is a vent right above you,\nMight wanna keep an eye on that...\n\nVent repair: mangle is easy, just press buttons and flip switches. Be sure to stop every once in a while to keep Mangle away, she is scared by light.\nEnnard: this can be tricky. Stage 1: just push buttons, but don’t take too long. Stage 2: use the gears to get the others. Once all are working you will advance. Stage 3: push buttons, don’t take too long.\n\nNight terrors: Funtime Freddy: just use fnaf 4 strat. If you don’t know what that is... \ngo from door to door, when you are there listen for breathing, I would wait around 3-5 seconds before flashing the light. If you hear breathing, shut the door immediately. DO NOT FLASH THE LIGHT!!! If you do not hear breathing, flash the light to scare off anything in the hallways.\nNightmarionne: Watch for white eyes, if you see them shut the door and wait around 5-7 seconds, then go to the next door. His tentacles will come from the closet, the hole in the ceiling and under the bed, bat these off with your flashlight! Your flashlight will glitch depending on how much danger you are in. Baby: shut the door at the last second when she sees you. Don’t close them for too long or the plush baby’s will attack. Don’t open the door for a while until the plush baby’s get crazy, they kinda act as your timer. Nightmare Fredbear: watch for red eyes, if you see them shut the door. If you hear him laugh check your bed, if he is not there go IMMEDIATELY to the closet, if he is not on the bed then don’t use the light at all and go directly to the closet. DO NOT FLASH THE CLOSET FOR ANY REASON. At the beginning, stay in the middle to hear his footsteps. There is not reason for the flashlight unless he is on the bed. If you see red eyes approaching you from the hallway, DO NOT FLASH! This will cause him to teleport to the door.\n\nWhew, I did it. I DEFINITELY spent to much time on this. Please mark this as helpful if you found it so. I want too see how many people I helped.\n\nHere is a little extra advice: it’s ok to be scared, honestly everyone was when they first started. (I was, even at the Home Screen I thought somethings was gonna jump out at me) and YOU DONT HAVE TO PLAY IF YOU DONT WANT TO. That’s an amazing part about oculus, you can just throw on the headset and run it whenever you want. Don’t like scary games? Don’t buy. Don’t like feeling trapped? Don’t buy. Don’t like being up close to the very things that will end your game? Don’t play. There is no shame in being scared, everyone is. This game really isn’t really good to play if it’s your first time with either fnaf or vr in general. It’s 30 dollars, so be sure you want to play it, and be ready to be scared when you do.",
