							"reviewDescription": "This is one of the first games I bought on my new Quest 2 (first VR I’ve ever owned) and I was BLOWN AWAY at how immersive it is! There have been a couple times where, even with my “VR legs”steadily beneath me, I got a bit freaked out as if I was going to fall off a cliff. Very, very cool! It is definitely a workout as others have mentioned, but I think that’s a great thing for a video game to accomplish. Unfortunately, as others have mentioned, the glitches on Quest 2 are a real thing. I was hoping that they’d be fixed by the time I bought it or that my experience would\nsomehow be different than others. It wasn’t. I too have been very frustrated by getting close to the end of a long climb, only to have the game inexplicably turn off all of a sudden. It happened to me twice yesterday. You don’t get to pick up where you left off, but instead are forced to start over at the very beginning. So, so frustrating! The developers have done a great job on this game and I’m excited to see The Climb 2, but PLEASE fix the glitches on this one. It could be one of the very best games ever. I would easily give it 5 stars if it didn’t glitch.",
