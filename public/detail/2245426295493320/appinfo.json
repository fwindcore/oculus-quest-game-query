I’m happy to announce that our biggest update yet, is now live!\n\nFirst off, we have updated our scoring and notification system across all maps! Now when your team is controlling the point, you will hear a music beat that pulses throughout the arena. We have also included a new free arena to the game, Gemini, that pits teams against each other in a small fast paced arena.\n\nJust so you know, this update handles scoring a little differently. Every 10 seconds you or one of your teammates is within the boundaries of the Control Point; your team scores a point. Teams still earn more points by having more players in the Control Point, but now your opponent can disrupt your score progress by stepping within the active boundary. During a contested encounter, both team scores pause until there is only one team left within the Control Point.\n\nThat's just a few of the awesome changes we've made with this update! If you'd like to know everything, take a look at the most recent patch notes.\n\n1.08 Update:\n￭ New Map Gemini\n￭ New Music & Lighting during zone captures\n￭ New Announcer VO added to Warm Up & Match\n￭ Updated Scoring System\n￭ Updated Critical Hit Headshot SFX\n￭ Alternate Sprint option added\n￭ Fixed graphics not loading issue (“god mode”)\n￭ Leaderboard temporarily removed for repairs  \n￭ Addressed Shield & Mine placement issues\n￭ Improved Control Point number indicators in all maps\n￭ Squad stability improvements \n￭ VOIP muting updates\n￭ Vignette improvements to be more impactful\n￭ Bug Fixes & General Improvements\n\nThanks for playing, and if you run into any issues please send us a support Ticket. If you want to stay in the know on everything Solaris, make sure to subscribe to our YouTube. If you really wanna get involved, feel free to join our Discord or Facebook group. Lastly, if you just want live updates, follow us on Twitter!\n\nSee you all online!\nShabs\n",

							"body_text": "Hello Athlons!\n\nShabs here, hope everyone is doing well and staying safe. I’m happy to announce that our latest update is now live.\n\nSquad up and hop in the all new Pre-Match Warm Up Lobby, where you can explore the map, chat with your teammates, pick up weapons, and practice ejecting your opponents. In addition to that, we’ve also implemented a system underneath that will start matches a few minutes after 4 players join. This means you won't be waiting too long to start a match, even if the player count happens to be less than 8. Now don’t forget, this is just the first iteration and you will continue to see updates and improvements as we evolve with your feedback.\n\nOn top of that, you will also be able to communicate with your squadmates while in the squad menu thanks to the addition of Vivox communications (another area where you will see more improvements over time). We’ve also removed Vortex Prime from map rotation and we tuned the Shotgun so it still packs quite the punch at close to medium range, but is no longer as effective at long range encounters. We believe it feels a lot better as a CQB weapon now, but as always, we’ll be listening and watching for your feedback.\n\n1.06 Update:\n￭ Pre-Match Social Lobby\n￭ Minimum player requirement for starting matches reduced to 4\n￭ Shotgun balance adjustments\n￭ Vortex Prime removed from map rotation\n￭ Improved VOIP System\n￭ Bug Fixes & General Improvements\n\nThanks for playing, and if you run into any issues please send us a support Ticket.

The game takes so long to actually find a game. When it actually finds one, the lobby is so empty. Once more people play, I’m pretty sure it’ll make the game more fun. One thing to fix this for now is for the game developers to add game AIs. This would make the load times slower and instead play against bots instead of waiting 5 years. Also if you guys do decide to make Ais, make a singleplayer/co-op mode vs AI. Would be super helpful if you guys added this.",
