			"display_long_description": "Star Wars: Tales from the Galaxy's Edge is an action-adventure experience where you’ll travel to the planet Batuu and get caught up in your own unforgettable story. You’ll fight alongside classic characters like R2-D2 and C-3PO (Anthony Daniels), and face intimidating villains, like Guavian Death Gang cell leader Tara Rashin (Debra Wilson). Visit Seezelslak (Bobby Moynihan) in his cantina to pick up missions that will take you into the wilds of Batuu — or become part of an all-new tale alongside Jedi Master Yoda (Frank Oz) himself.\n\nThe experience takes place on the outskirts of Black Spire Outpost on the planet of Batuu, as depicted in Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge, the immersive epic lands at Disneyland Resort in California and Walt Disney World Resort in Florida. You’ll take on the role of a droid repair technician operating near the planet, but when a group of pirates attack you hit the escape pods and crash on Batuu, where you’ll discover that anyone in the galaxy can become a hero.",

							"reviewDescription": "I was given early access to this game to review for VRFitness Insider. For a Quest 2 game it really has the visual wow factor, and runs smoothly enough that it could easily pass as a PCVR title. I loved the gunplay and the attack droids, and the All-Kit multi tool sections were fun and added variety to the experience.\n\nThe game's production values are very quality, it's just a shame it's not very long. It took me a couple hours to beat the main quest, although the game continues past that and you still have some side missions and achievements to unlock. I'd say there's about 5 or 6 hours of content here, and it's fun enough that I could happily replay it on a harder difficulty.\n\nI look forward to the next one in the series.\n\nYou can check out my full review below\n\nhttps://www.vrfitnessinsider.com/star-wars-tales-from-the-galaxys-edge-vr-review-blast-your-way-through-this-brief-but-brilliant-adventure/",
