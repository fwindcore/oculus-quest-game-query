The locations are stunning with lots of cool surprises and unlike other apps, here you are with just 3 other people and can have decent grown up conversations with strangers if you don’t have any real friends online or who own headsets.\n\nThe avatar creation is the best I’ve seen and you can go to any of the cool “destinations” and soon people will ask to join and you can accept them and have interesting conversations with people from all over the world.  If you are the host, you can kick anyone out if they become a problem. I haven’t tried joining others yet but it was fun being a host to random strangers and finding out a bit about them. Being confined to four people and not able to move around leads to better conversations. When my headset was about to die I gave host duties to someone else and he put up a video screen with some silly video but no one seemed to know if we could add our own videos or go online or watch our own streaming accounts. If that’s not there, I hope it’s added. \n\nThe one issue I had a problem with was my controllers. My arms were moving out of control at times, even when I put down the controllers, my avatar’s arms were still moving. If this is fixed I’ll move it up to five stars. \n\nI always feel uncomfortable walking up to strangers in other social apps and starting conversations, but with this, I can just host a room and accept guests to join me. Even if I’m alone for awhile, the locations are so cool, I can just relax in them and look around.",

In terms of your controller issue, we've found that our controllers can behave like this in vTime or other apps when the lighting isn't great or the battery is low, but we'll try to reproduce in the studio.",
