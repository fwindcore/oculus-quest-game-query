							"reviewDescription": "The first thing this game taught me was that I had been serving all wrong in the real world! We had a family and friends table in our house growing up and nobody ever questioned my serve, LOL! Enter Eleven Table Tennis! At first I got so frustrated, I was tempted to get a refund on the game. How could this game NOT recognize my serve?\n\nThankfully, I decided to reach out to the Developers via Discord and much to my pleasant surprise, they were not only quick to respond, but they helped me realize the problem was with how I had been taught to serve and it was not the game itself.\n\nOne cool part of this game (and there are many) is the Serve Training area. I spent hours in there literally retraining myself how to serve \"legally\". Then it suddenly dawned on me: I had forgotten I was in VR since it felt so REAL. The table, the physics of the paddle and the ball, and the sound the ball makes when it hits the paddle or the table are spot on. Best of all, you never have to retrieve your balls.\n\nAfter I got the hang of serving properly, I began playing matches against the AI to get the feel for the game again. So much fun I didn't want to stop, lost track of time and was almost late for an appointment, LOL!\n\nThe bottom line for me is that Eleven Table Tennis is now one of those games that I want to play every day, it's that good. It is also a great way to get the blood pumping and even work up a little sweat. So if you love to play Ping Pong (Table Tennis) in the real world, this is a must have game on the OQ2. \n\nYou can play your friends and you can challenge (and except challenges from) players all over the world. How cool is that? I played my first game against another person today and it was a blast. We talked to each other, gave each other pointers and had a lot of fun playing the game. This player had some nice spin on his shots, which has inspired me to work on that in my own game.\n\nThis is the ultimate VR game with endless replay value. Well worth the price!",
