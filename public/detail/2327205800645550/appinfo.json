							"body_text": "We at FitXR have big plans to build the most comprehensive virtual fitness club on the planet. And so we’re launching a bunch of major updates that we cannot wait for you to try.\n\nThe brand new features mean you will be able to workout with your friends via a new Multiplayer feature, have access to the full library of on-demand classes, take up fresh classes offered each day and enjoy original tracks from major and indie record labels. On top of this, we’ll also be launching our third fitness studio, coming very soon. So keep your eyes peeled for that!\n\nWhat’s new: key features\n\nWe’re extremely proud to have such a passionate community so we make sure we listen to our customers and use this feedback to continuously improve the FitXR experience. We believe the best way to do this is by constantly delivering fresh content and upgrades, so we’re excited to launch a new membership model, which is available from today on the Oculus Quest platform for $9.99 a month.\n\nTo thank our existing users for being such loyal fans, we’ll be giving them a 90-day free membership at launch, while new members will have access to a 7-day free membership trial. However, membership is completely optional so if you’re an existing user, you don’t have to sign up if you don’t want to - the app will stay as-is without you losing any previously purchased content and you’ll still get to enjoy multiplayer and some HIIT classes once they’re released.\n\nAs part of your membership, you’ll get:\n\n- A new class released every day\n- Multiplayer\n- Brand new studios — HIIT launching mid-May\n- Music from major and indie record labels\n- New Environments\n- Refreshed menu and easier navigation\n\nFitXR: A step above the rest\n\nFitXR was founded with a fitness-first mission; with an aim to make fitness approachable, and fun, for all. Since 2017, we have listened intently to you, our community, and constantly evolved the product based on your feedback. We’ve also invested all revenues back into development and plan to continue as such for the foreseeable future.\n\nWe believe that FitXR is the only at-home fitness product that delivers a unique blend of group fitness, gaming and immersion. All of this translates to an experience that feels more like play than what most people relate to with exercise. To quote one of our members, “it's the best thing to happen to exercise since exercise.”\n\nBy offering FitXR at the lowest subscription price currently available, we’re making it accessible to a broad range of members looking to have fun with their fitness. This is just one way in which FitXR delivers on its promise to bring an unrivaled fitness experience to all, a place where members can meet new people, work out together and achieve that real group, workout experience from the comfort of their homes.\n\nWe hope you enjoy the new updates and features as much as we do. We’re excited to hear from you!\n\nAll our best,\nSam & Sameer",

							"reviewDescription": "Ok, before the update it was kinda nice  .... some features missing (like any interaction with other players or playing with friends) buyt overall pretty nice app. I even bought one of the packs and enjoyed it during covid lockdown to keep some basic exercise. After new update they changed to monthly subscription, my PAID app have only a few 3min workouts available for free and the songs I bought via pack are not available to me anymore. HUGE LET DOWN and basically a SCAM.\n\nEDIT OK Support helped me with the issue. I would give 4 stars before the update. Now I give 3 stars at most (and I actually feel generous by giving you 3 stars, should be 2,5). \nNew UI has better visuals but it is really REALLY pain to use. There is no sorting or filtering of classes (you could filter by intensity, music genre, and other options easily before the update and classes were sorted according to their length so it was easy to find the class you wanted to try). Now you have to go through the list of classes 1 by 1 ... means you have to click 26 times to get to class number 25, classes are sorted by some weird random (?) order, not by name, not by instructor, intensity or length, so it is really pain to find the one you remember from before ... or when you want to try some other boxing class of intermediate difficulty and length about 15 minutes, you have to scroll through all 46 classes to see them all and ofc you forget the ones you noticed in the beginning. On the plus side new night class environment is nice. I wish you would work on this update more before you roll it out. \nFunny thing is that there are new classes with the update I think. And that is very nice in theory ... but it makes it even more difficult to find the right one.\n\nThe game itself remains good. If you think about buying the game and read this some time after this review you can add 1 star (assuming the devs improve UI).",

If you are having trouble finding your classes however, please could you email us at support@fitxr.com and let us know your FitXR account ID (this can be found in Settings) and your Oculus username so we can investigate this further for you? \n\nI'd also really like to reassure you that membership is completely optional for you and you will never lose what you've paid for. As a thank you for being a dedicated member of our FitXR community, you will receive a 90-day free trial as soon as you upgrade your account to the latest version. Following this, if you decide not to continue your membership after the trial, then it will return to how it was before the update to the app. \n\nThis means you’ll still have access to all of the content you had previously, including all of the FitXR workouts you owned before the update as well as any DLC packs you’ve purchased. As an added bonus, you’ll still be able to play multiplayer classes with your friends.\n\nI hope this helps reassure you and please do reach out to us directly at support@fitxr.com if you have any further questions as we'd be more than happy to help.",
