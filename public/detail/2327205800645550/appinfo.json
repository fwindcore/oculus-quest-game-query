Jump into a HIIT class and test your agility, endurance and reaction speed through guided workouts that will challenge you like no other home workout!\n\nBuilt from the ground up based on sports science, it takes inspiration from a fitness device used to help train F1 drivers, yet caters to all abilities and fitness levels.\n\nIn the same way that a HIIT class involves short bursts of intense activity to get your heart rate pumping, the HIIT studio will push you to your limit through a series of fast-paced cues that you smash as they light up around you.\n\nThink whack-a-mole, but on a totally different level: way more engaging, challenging and fun!\n\nBENEFITS\nApart from feeling amazing from the rush of endorphins that you’ll get post-workout, a HIIT class will help achieve a higher calorie burn, increased metabolic rate and improved oxygen consumption.\n\nOvertime, the health benefits include greater strength, speed and reaction times leading to an overall improved athletic performance.\n\nAVAILABLE AT LAUNCH\nHIIT is launching with 3 intro classes available to all regardless of whether or not you're a member.\n\nWe will then release new HIIT classes every week as part of our weekly schedule for those who have signed up for membership.",

							"reviewDescription": "Scummy behavior by scummy developer\n\nUPDATE : Beware of the fake 5 star reviews. FitXR has resorted to bribing people in exchange for a positive review. They will do anything to rip you off and take your $$$. \n\nYou have been warned and you have to decide if you want to trust this company that changes their name and/or business model every 6 months. This same company baited people into paying $30 for what they thought was a full game that could be expanded with DLC and could be played offline, when their plan all along was to strip down the game, remove DLC options and the ability to play offline, and start charging a monthly subscription fee (they didn’t let their existing customers know about this sneaky plan).  They should have created a new subscription based game but they didn’t because they wanted to leverage the existing positive reviews for the previous non subscription version. Classic bait and switch. \n\nDo you really want to give your hard earned money to a shady, unethical developer? They will pull the same scam again if gullible buyers let them do it. \n\nThere are many fitness games available on the Quest that are more fun and don’t require a monthly fee to use. There is literally no reason you should pay $120 a year to use this app. \n\nIf you’re ok with a monthly reoccurring fee, checkout Apple Fitness+ instead. It’s the same price but a MUCH better value and has better workouts. Most importantly, Apple is not scamming it’s users, unlike FitXR.\n\n******\nPrevious review: \n\nFitXR used to be great, now it’s just an epic failure on so many levels.  Developer uses scummy tactics to trick you out of your money. \n\nX-Booster is now my go to game for fitness. No monthly sub and you can use your own music to generate beat maps. Thrill of the Fight, Synth Riders, Audio Trip,  Oh Shape, Song Beater, Pistol Whip, Knockout League, PowerbeatsVR, Dance Central and Hitstream are also great fitness games that don’t require a monthly fee to play. \n\nThis developer has a history of using bait and switch tactics to sell their app (remember BoxVR?). Now they suddenly change to a greedy subscription model without giving existing users any prior notice!\n\nThey want people to pay $10 a month, $120 per year, for “one new (crappy repetitive and uninspiring) workout a day”. If you end your subscription, you LOSE access to those workouts. The game doesn’t even work half of the time. \n\n $10 a month for this subpar app is a no for me dawg. $10 a month is ridiculous when I can get services that offer 1000% more value like a real gym membership, or Netflix, or GamePass, or Prime, or Hulu for that price instead. There are plenty of other workout games for the Quest that don't require a monthly fee and give a workout that's just as good or better than FitXR.\n\nNow to the actual game content. The boxing part of the game is just ok. Think Beat Saber but with suckier music, a lower frame rate, and stuttering gameplay.   The new workouts that they want you to pay $10 a month for are basically just computer generated beat maps with awful, unrecognizable music,  with the so called instructor saying \"new points level\" every 30 seconds. The moves don’t sync with the music very well. Also, There's no real instruction. \nThere’s no warm up or cool down. \n\nThe “dance studio” is atrocious. Like, it’s so so so bad that it’s sad. It’s just a weird, janky looking CGI trainer with annoying voiceovers. Looks like something a 6th grader would create in an intro to game development class. I have second hand embarrassment for FitXR for putting out that hot garbage and thinking people would want to pay $10 a month for it.\n\nTried HIIT and it wasn’t fun at all. Same poorly animated trainer as the janky dance studio. Requires a  lot of space. A lot of my punches did not register correctly. I quit halfway through because the commentary annoyed me so much. Definitely not worth paying $10 monthly. \n\n\nMultiplayer - your friends will need to pay for a subscription too. But if you're a real friend you'd tell your friend to stay away from this app. There’s no server based public multiplayer rooms like with other VR games. You have to have a code. If you want to find someone to play with, you have to take off your headset, get on Facebook, and find a code or share your code. It’s tedious and sucks the fun out of it. \n\nTHEY REMOVED THE ABILITY TO PLAY OFFLINE. If you travel a lot and/or don’t have access to a high speed internet connection, you cannot play this game. \n\nThey make a lot of promises to fix the bugs,  but the developer is so disingenuous that you can’t trust anything they say. I have lost faith in FitXR. Stay away from this app.",
