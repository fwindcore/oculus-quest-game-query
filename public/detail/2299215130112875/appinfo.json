I would suggest playing Vader immortal, onward, population one, and epic roller coasters. Stand up on the roller coasters and then decide. Remember, THIS GAME IS INTENSE. Be ready. This game is amazing but I would like a campaign and more maps.  This game is awesome i can't stress that enough.  Gaining your vr legs will take some time.  It takes about 6 to 8 months so don't buy this if you just got your FIRST vr headset. Have fun. 😁😁",
