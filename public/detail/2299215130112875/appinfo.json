							"reviewDescription": "There are a lot of vr games that have fighting with swords or guns. A lot of games that have teleport or smooth locomotion. A lot of games that are single player only.\nThis game combines the best of all worlds(and co op) seamlessly while allowing you to do prince of Persia parkour and has a great sense of progression. At first I'm like, \"this is just robo recall mixed with ninja legends.\" But then I realized this game was so much more. There are many different weapons and playstyles. Wanna be a swordsman? There's a loadout you can customize for that. Wanna be Katnis Everdeen? There's a loadout you can customize for that. Wanna be in the matrix, deflect bullets and backflip over enemies and run on walls? Guess what... you can do that with any load out. Customize your gear and armor, and play with your closest friends, or people you don't even know. This is seriously one of my favorite games now. The dlc packages add extra stages and weapons but are not essential to the experience. The dlc packages are also well priced, and I look forward to future updates. The game sets you in a stage and gives you, the cyber ninja, full free choice how to accomplish your goal. Missions don't take too long, and its easy to pick up and play just a round or two, while also having plenty of customisation options. The motions can be a bit disorienting however, and this game should not be your first vr experience because you will likely fall over until your body and eyes are accustomed to virtual reality. I play this game until my headset runs out of batteries, because there are so many great weapon options. Big thumbs up. Not to mention there are plenty of settings to get the feel of handling the controls just right. Much love 💘. \n-PM",
