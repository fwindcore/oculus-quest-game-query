							"reviewDescription": "I loaded in really excited to check it out and say hi to other people on their islands but it’s super super uncreative. There’s a lot of flaws with the mechanics and unlockables. For example:\nI booted up the game and only had the city center unlocked and nothing else. Normal right? I have to unlock the rest of the island to get the mine and farm n stuff. \n\nWhy does it make sense that i can load into someone’s island with everything unlocked and use their tools to get supplies from the work they did\n\nI literally have every fruit, and items i need and all i unlocked was just the farm. (Shout out to that random kid blade113 for just loaning me his entire island to just mine supplies for an hour)\n\nAlso: No creativity is involved\nNo island is different from the other\nI don’t understand why you would be exited to go to someone’s island if it’s literally the same\n\nAnd NO ITEMS DESPAWN\nAUUUGGGHH\nI mine a tree, grab three wood\nThe rest of the tree is forever there\nI create a chunk glitch with so much poop but next time i log in it’s still there! It literally is covering my island and if i throw it into the water it teleports back.\n\nWHAT??!! How am I supposed to get rid of this stack of literally useless item if I cant give it to people of discard it?? \n\nLong story short\nRandom people like me can talk to your children and there’s no muting, they can hear you whenever they join\n\nThe game mechanics are really terrible\n\nAnd after literally my one hour of gameplay I clipped through floors and dropped all my islanders into a void, put a cat into and endless loop of falling by placing a hill to the water where he spawns in, and covered my island in literal poop with no way to dispose of it\n\nSo if you like poop and cursing 5 year olds\nGet this game\nI highly doubt these will get fixed even though they are really simple fixer uppers because this game was 11$",
