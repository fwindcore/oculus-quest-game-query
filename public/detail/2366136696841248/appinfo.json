							"reviewDescription": "This was one of the BEST games I ever played on Oculus Quest 2. Not only is it rich and beautiful graphics, it's literally everything else that a VR game should be. \n\nThe storyline was entertaining and wonderful and actually had me in tears a few times. The movement mechanics were well thought out, allowed you to pan around,  move through, and adjust your environment in a seamless way. (I only knocked my drink over once. And fortunately I was on the last sip so I didn't waste too much alcohol LOL)\n\nThe puzzles were beginner to intermediate at best but, I was totally okay with that. It also had a nice balance of puzzles, dialogue storytelling, and skill tricks to keep things from getting monotonous. \n\nI played The Room Dark Matter, Myst, I Expect You to Die, Red Matter, Down the Rabbit Hole etc...and sometimes those puzzles we're beyond intuitive and needing some cheats to figure them out. This game was a nice break from banging your head against the wall. You still had to think but they weren't impossible.\n\nI have a busy life and really only get to play anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour at a clip so, it took me about a week to finish. Unless I'm missing something, the only downside was not being able to save in the middle of a chapter so, if I had to stop before finishing a chapter next time I played I'd have to start over from the beginning of that chapter. But aside from that really hope that they do a sequel!",
