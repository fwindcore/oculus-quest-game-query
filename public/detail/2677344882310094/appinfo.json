Experience a first person shooter as you never have before: Onward combines mil-sim gameplay with the experience of playing in virtual reality. Players cannot rely on crosshairs or mini maps, instead you rely on coordination and communication with your squad in order to succeed at your objective. Realistic combat mechanics and artificial locomotion will push your combat survival skills to their limit as you engage in infantry combat across a large variety of maps and combat situations.\n\nOnward features a wide variety of solo, coop and competitive game modes. Take to the online battlefield and join your friends in cross-platform combat in a high stakes clash with up to ten people and best your opponents on a strategic and tactical level in an Uplink or Assault match, chase down AI bots in a Hunt mission or wait for extraction as waves of enemies approach you during an Evac mission. The only way is Onward.",

							"body_text": "\n\nHello everyone!\n\nWe are pleased to announce that the time for the 1.8.7 update is now! This update is primarily focused on audio upgrades and the re-release of the Snowpeak map, but also contains a lot of bug fixes and general improvements.\n\nOur audio improvements comprise amongst many other things gunshots that are more consistent in their quality, more immersive and directional footsteps, higher quality voice chat, more immersive environmental sound, and more consistency between the volumes of different sources. Two new features for audio are the ability to independently adjust the volume of gunshots and voices, and audio mixing presets to select.\n\nEnjoy those updated audio sounds while playing again on the re-released Snowpeak map (day and night versions available!) and hear the crunch of the snow under your feet as you tactically sneak around on the ice to get that perfect shot in as you notice the other team coming your way. Snowpeak features long distance engagement and close quarter combat options. This map will test your skills in stealth and tactical abilities.\n\nSmoke grenades have also been reworked. They have changed to spherical from the previous comic spray to allow them to be used in a more predictable way which benefits gameplay. Full screen tint will be more accurately bound to the area of the smoke, and is harder to see through. We have also fixed an issue where AI wasn’t affected by smoke grenades and could ‘see’ players as usual. Finally and perhaps most importantly scopes no longer fully tint when looking at smoke grenades, allowing you to see players in front of the smoke through scopes once more.\n\nUpdate 1.8.7 is available now and will download automatically. Enjoy!",

							"reviewDescription": "Im not good at writing reviews so heres a pro con list for you to decide for yourself\n\n\nPros:\n- guns feel very nice and solid, gunplay is one of the best in vr and they’re just satisfying to shoot and reload\n- paid, less children\n- a wide variety of guns with all of the classics (ak, m16, aug, etc.) included\n- realistic (if you like that)\n- crouching in game and going prone in game require you to do so irl so no crouchspamming\n- movement isnt too fast or too slow\n- proximity and team chat are seperate\n- colored smoke grenades\n- drones (something almost never seen in fps)\n- co op mode is actually fun and can get tense at times\n- grabbing things straight from peoples hands instead of having them drop it on the floor can speed things up\n\nCons:\n- (MAJOR) crashing and blackscreening is a big issue\n- Small number of (official) maps, 7 each with a day and night mode. only 2 or 3 maps can be played in assault mode\n- not a lot of weapon customization (i personally love this but my friends complain a lot about it)\n-Near instantaneous ttk (if you dont like that)\n- smaller number of modes, team deathmatch isnt even a mode\n- no penalty for teamkilling and/or leaving\n- playerbase is very toxic\n- quite a lot of squeakers\n- drone footage in black and white\n- basically no recoil with foregrips makes lmgs a bit broken\n- c4 blast radius is waaaay too big\n- (this one is more of a personal gripe) oversaturation of ars, i would love to see a revolver, more smgs, or new shotguns added into the game\n\nMy idea for adding a revolver and how it would work. It would start out like a shotgun, you load it one by one. An attachment could be the speedloader\n\nThat being said i think the pros outweigh the cons",
