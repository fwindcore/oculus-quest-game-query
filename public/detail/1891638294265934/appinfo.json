							"reviewDescription": "This is the first review I’ve written on any of the Oculus games I’ve purchased. I hesitated to buy this game but then I hesitate spending money on anything. But I did get it and I’ve been making pots and selling them.￼ i’ve completed a few challenges and have earned some money to buy more colors and patterns. Even though it’s not real, it feels like I’m actually creating something, which is very fun. I still haven’t found the outdoor gallery that shows up in the video, but I assume I have to reach some level or other before I can see it. I agree with others that say the game needs hand tracking and I’d also like to be able to put my hand down into a pot to mold it from inside. Also i’d like to use ￼both hands. ￼All in all, this is a very fun game.￼ \n\nIt’s now several days from getting this game so I want to add another note. This game continues to fascinate me. I changed my rating from four stars to five stars now that I have more experience with it. The challenges get progressively harder but also teach how to play the game￼￼. I’m currently stuck on an Egyptian challenge but I’ll solve it eventually. I have learned how to make some really lovely virtual pots. The only other thing I would really like to have in this game is the opportunity to see what other players have been making. Perhaps a large online gallery could become available after a certain level where players can put one or two of their own best pieces and be able to walk around and see what others have been making.\n\nMonths later...\n\nI just changed my review from a 5 to a 1. I thought hand tracking would be great on this app but it turns out that it’s terrible. And I can’t turn it off. Disabling and tracking in the oculus menu disables the ability to do anything in the game. When I’ve made a pot I can’t get to the burn menu without the pot changing shape because my fingers are close to it. This is been my favorite game as long as I’ve had it. I really hope the developers  enable a way to go back to using the controllers.\n\n\nI got a nice response from the developer. They said that a mistake has been made and that they have now fixed it. But unfortunately it’s not fixed. Now there’s no way to mold a pot using the controllers. I can do it with my hands using hand tracking but I can’t do it with the controllers because all I can see is the controllers. There’s no hand that shows up the way it used to be. Once again I tried to send the developers an email but once again the email didn’t go. Hopefully they’ll read this and respond.￼￼\n\n\nI’ve changed my review back up to five stars. This has been my favorite game ever since I got it and now that it works again I’m happy to give it five stars. The developer responded nicely to the problems. Everything I’ve tried on the new version so far has worked out. If you want to just sit and relax and do something creative, this is an excellent game for you.",
