				"change_log": "Rec Room PATCH  - the \"Circuits V2\" edition\n\n## Dear Creators, we've given the Streaming Camera some love:\n\n- The Streaming Camera was previously only available for PC VR, but is now also available to Screens PC players with multiple monitors -- no VR headset required! The streamer camera will output to a secondary monitor once turned on.\n- Once you've activated the Streaming Camera, there is a shortcut to the Stream Mixer from the home page of the watch\n- The Streaming Camera now has a light on it. You can adjust the intensity and range of the light in the Stream Mixer Settings. Note: this light is only for the player using the Streaming camera -- other players won't see it.  Think of it as a camera filter!\n- The Stream Mixer also has a new option called Voice Mixer -- use this to soften voices as you see fit.\n- Frame Rate, Field of View, and Light Settings are now persisted to your account\n- And last but not least...\n\n## Dear Creators, Introducing... the Streaming Camera Point gadget!\n\n- Streaming Camera Points can be wired to gizmos -- have fun making an animated camera rig invention!\n- The Streaming Camera Point can be found in the Palette under the Gadgets > Other Gadgets\n- Each Streaming Camera Point shows up in the Stream Mixer -- use the arrows to cycle through them!\n- Each Streaming Camera has a configurable Camera Name. Unnamed cameras will just show up as \"Custom #\" in the Stream Mixer with a number in the order they were spawned.\n- Each Streaming Camera Point has a configurable Transition Time. By default, the camera smoothly follows the target over a short amount of time, but you can choose the Instant option if you want no smoothing.\n\n## Certified Inventions\nIn this update we are introducing Certified Inventions! \"Certified\" is a seal of quality. Before an invention is granted Certified status, we review it to ensure it works well, is efficient, and follows best practices. [Certified Inventions](https://imgur.com/a/VMKpEoX) can be identified by the signature blue banner in the Invention Store.\nAt first this list will be curated by us to emphasize CV2-powered creations, but we plan to open this up more in the future to any invention. For circuits-powered inventions especially, we may request changes to follow best practices and optimize heat usage.\nIf you have an invention right now you think fits this criteria, check out [Certified Inventions](https://recroom.com/inventions)!\n\n## General Improvements and Bug Fixes\n\n- Fixed a hang during \\^Orientation for PS4 users with their system language set to Arabic, Thai and potentially others.\n- We updated the doors in \\^RecCenter to use our new room search menu. We also noticed that the community door in \\^StuntRunner was getting a little stale, so we updated it to show all rooms with the #StuntRunner tag!\n- We've found and fixed a bug that we believe was causing some of the invincibility issues players have been seeing in RROs (especially \\^Paintball). We'll be keeping an eye on this and related invincibility issues, so if you are still seeing this issue or variations of it, please let us know through our feedback channels!\n- A confused goblin decided to steal buttons from the Room Settings page instead of the Golden Trophy, we've got them back in their right spots!\n- Scale and Manipulate were a bit down, so we've comforted them and they should be much better now!\n- Fixed an issue where deleted events could still be seen in the upcoming events tab.\n- Fixed a bug where play menu tabs sometimes showed the wrong rooms.\n- Fixed an issue where the outline effect wouldn't show correctly on Oculus Quest.\n- Fixed an issue where the palette search would not work.\n- Fixed an issue where you could no longer Self-Scale properly.\n- Fixed a Config Menu issue where VR players couldn't type in slider fields.\n- Fixed CV1 Trigger Zones not registering decoration objects.\n\nAs always, thanks for playing Rec Room!\n\nPlease see here for convenient links to controls, tutorials, comfort options, etc.: https://recroom.com/community\nWe love to hear your feedback, so please don't hesitate to let us know what you think...",
