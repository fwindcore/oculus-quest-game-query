				"change_log": "Rec Room UPDATE - the \"Rec Royale Update\" edition\n\n_Rec Royale is now available to players on iOS and Quest 2! We’ve also added a ton of awesome new stuff to Rec Royale for the first time since its initial release!_\n\n- We’ve added 15 new levels to earn!\n- We added six new Frontier Pass tiers - rewards include Scout Sashes, 5-Star Boxes, and new Butterfly Wings!\n- We also made it easier to earn Frontier Pass tiers - this means some existing Rec Royale players will jump up a number of tiers.\n- And we're doubling all Rec Royale XP for the next month!\n\nWe’ve also added six new weapons to the island!\n\n- The Beam Cannon power weapon from Laser Tag is a new Legendary weapon!\n- The Paint Thrower from Sunset Drive-in is a new Legendary weapon!\n- Paint Mines are a new Epic weapon!\n- The Deafening Boomstick (CotBM Blunderbuss)  is a new Legendary weapon!\n- The Hunter's Dream Crossbow from CCC is a new Legendary weapon!\n- Last, and unfortunately least, the Goblin Annoyer Crossbow (from GT)  is a new Rare weapon!\n\nWe’ve also done some re-balancing of existing weapons:\n- Flintlocks are more rare, but have increased damage.\n- Bows have increased damage and projectile speed, but are more rare and can only be legendary.\n\nBut wait, there’s more!\n\n- We have added _4 new body shapes_ to help players personalize their avatars even more! The new shapes are: Pear, Apple, Triangle, and Hourglass. The standard shape is now called “Square.”\n- Another new way to customize your look is with our new (and totally optional) ears! We have also included a few earrings to get you started with your new look.\n- It is currently expected behavior that equipping a costume will reset your body shape to Square while you are wearing the costume, and it will revert back to your chosen shape once the costume is removed.\n\nAdditionally, the HUD on screens buttons and control hints have a fresh new look and some exciting new features:\n\n- New Picture-In-Picture window for Screen players. Get a look at yourself at any time in the corner of the screen, and see how you appear to other players while you wave, emote, talk, and interact. Toggle the Picture-In-Picture in the watch menu, gameplay settings.\n- Room Chat gets an upgraded look & layout for all platforms. The message list is a bit longer and scrollable now. Open a player's profile by selecting their photo in the Room Chat list to conveniently cheer, friend, mute, or whatever you need to do :)\n- Every button in the top row of the HUD now has a physical button associated with it. You can find your share camera and maker pen in the equipment radial menu.\n\nOne more little addition, you can now see avatar items organized as sets in Rec Room stores!\n\n## General Improvements\n\n- Added a new room permission to limit spawning of inventions.\n- Added a new room role to restrict consumable spawning.\n- Added support to allow users logging onto a new platform to use their existing RR account instead of creating a new account.\n- The watch no longer detaches when opening the Settings screen while in VR.\n- Fixed incorrect texture on left handle of maker pen palette in VR.\n- Patched exploits that would cause extreme grenade speeds.\n- Fixed an issue where your token balance would sometimes not include all of your tokens.\n- Outlines should now draw correctly around highlighted objects on Quest headsets.\n- Extended game controller support for iOS. Now you can use the many MFi compatible game controllers in addition to PlayStation and XBox controllers. Older MFi controllers or controllers that are lacking standard buttons may be partially supported. Additional controller settings are available in the iOS Settings app on iOS 14.\n- While holding the maker pen, screen players cannot pick up tools/shapes with their other hand. No more accidentally ripping apart your creations!\n- If screen players get spawned or squeezed into a spot that's too small for them to stand, they'll auto-crouch to try and fit.\n\nAs always, thanks for playing Rec Room!\n\nPlease see here for convenient links to controls, tutorials, comfort options, etc.: https://recroom.com/community\nWe love to hear your feedback, so please don't hesitate to let us know what you think… ",
