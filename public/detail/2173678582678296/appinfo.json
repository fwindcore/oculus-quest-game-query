				"change_log": "Rec Room PATCH  - the \"Circuits V2\" edition\n\n## Play Menu Upgrades!\n\n- The \"New\" tab is back! This page shows you some rooms that were recently published, so you can be among the first players to check them out.\n- Quick filter bars have been added to the \"Hot\" and search pages. This lets you narrow down the type of rooms you want to see with just a few quick button presses.\n- The Play Menu's top bar now includes a set of tags from the hottest rooms! Use these buttons to create a custom search that brings you to rooms with the latest trends. This is also a great way to find new contest rooms!\n\nWe're also trying out some [new format and layout changes](https://imgur.com/a/oU3eMlI), so please let us know what you think!\n\n## Screen Toss Improvements\n\n- We improved dropping/tossing objects for screen players. You can now underhand toss any object you're holding with the drop button, while also being able to drop objects in place like before. (So yes, you can officially juggle with your screen friends now!!)\n- Press and release the drop button to do an underhand toss, or hold it down for a moment to drop what you're holding in place.\n\n## New tubes!\nWe finally fixed tubes! Long-time creators know that textures get distorted on the end caps of tubes in weird (and sometimes useful) ways. As *some* of those creators know, this was never actually intended, and is a bug we've wanted to squash for a while, in order to let people create tubes that have the same look on all of their faces. That time is finally upon us!\n\n- Don't worry! Old tubes look the same as before, so your old creations are safe!\n- Newly created tubes won't have texture artifacts on their end caps by default.\n- If you're really craving that \"classic tube\" look, you can use the Configure tool to set tubes to use it.\n- _Bonus!_ You can now use the Configure tool to change the number of facets on a tube!\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/eKCBudV\n\n## New Configure Menu!\nWe've 'configured' the Configure Menu to have a brand new look!\nThe Configure Menu is no longer a part of the Palette, it now [pops up in world-space](https://imgur.com/Eq2JiwY) when you configure an object!\nThe UI is now vertical, you can scroll up and down to see all the configurable options on an object.\nOptions are placed in categories, you can drop down or close categories however you choose.\nThe new menu follows you around and looks at you, but if following you is not your building style, or knowing something follows you gives you shivers, you can pin it to a location by hitting the [pin button at the top right!](https://imgur.com/xetTtfQ).\n\n## Updates to Codes\n\n- Creating a code is now done right from the page of the watch that the code is for. Room codes are created on the room's page, event codes on the event's page, etc.\n- The button to *use* a code has been moved to the profile page.\n- The old Codes button on the homepage of the watch has been replaced by a new Invite button to make it easy to invite new people to Rec Room.\n\n## General Improvements and Bug Fixes\n\n- Introduce your friends - you can now send introductions to help a friend meet your other friends. [This feature is accessible from your friend's profile page and when you are notified that someone has accepted your friend request.](https://imgur.com/a/R1h5ARP) Gribbly, meet Beeboz!\n- Added the ability to click on a player's name to view their profile if you are in close proximity to them.\n- The Maker Pen \"Create Grabbable Objects\" setting is now a slider with a new \"Object Default\" option. Circuits, gizmos, shapes, and some props default to non-grabbable with this option, and basically anything that you can throw will default to grabbable. At last, you don't need to remember to mark every paint pistol you spawn as grabbable!\n- Added a confirmation dialog when unpublishing a room.\n- Added carousels to the shop to display the newest inventions published by creators you are subscribed to. Be the first to know about that sweet new dorm room skin!\n- Added a screen prompting new players to accept the Code of Conduct the first time they leave the dorm.\n- For older players going into \\^Orientation, we now make sure not to override your movement settings to the defaults.\n- Removed the unintended dot reticle for darts on screens.\n- Fixed a bug where the left arrow on the account selection screen sometimes didn't work.\n- Fixed a bug where using the back button in the watch while creating a club could get you stuck.\n- Fixed UI bugs where start and end game buttons were not updating when they should.\n- Fixed the \"switch team\" button not working sometimes.\n- For iOS players, we've adjusted some button sizes and priorities to make it less likely that you accidentally drop items when attempting to use them.\n- Fixes visual popping on the login screen.\n\nAs always, thanks for playing Rec Room!\n\nPlease see here for convenient links to controls, tutorials, comfort options, etc.: https://recroom.com/community\nWe love to hear your feedback, so please don't hesitate to let us know what you think...",
