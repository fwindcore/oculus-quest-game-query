Material/Color Eyedropper!\n\n - We've added a brand new Eyedropper tab alongside Materials and Colors in the Palette\n - Just use the Select Tool to select some objects and choose the Eyedropper option on the revamped Quick Action Menu\n - When you choose Eyedropper, the materials/colors from your selection are added to your Eyedropper history\n - You have an Eyedropper history of up to 16 items\n - If you select Eyedropper for a material/color combo that's already in your history, it's moved to the most recent slot rather than taking up duplicate slots in your history\n - When you hover over an Eyedropper item, the tooltip shows the Material and Color names\n - When you select an Eyedropper item, this is equivalent to selecting the material and color from their respective tabs\n - We now better visualize the currently selected item under the Material/Color/Eyedropper tabs\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/LebLHOt\n\n## General Improvements\n\n- VR players using walking can teleport to get out of self-scale again. We broke this a while ago, so it's about time we fixed it!\n- Fixed a bug which caused VR-to-screens handshakes to complete immediately. Now you get to hear that sweet drumroll again!\n- We also brought back the handshake feedback for VR-to-VR handshakes. It's far too awkward without the drumroll.\n- Fixed a bug which allowed VR and screen players to use opposite hands when shaking hands. (But not in Rec Royale... it's still there)\n- Screen players can no longer stealthily shake VR players' hands to friend them without their consent. That's right - no more ninja-friending. Wait, when did my friends list become full of ninjas?\n- Fixed a bug which allowed VR players to shake screen players' hands from across the room. You'll have to find another way to make your long distance friendships work.\n- Fixed Rotator and Piston Gizmos behaving erratically or not working when players leave the room, along with other small weirdnesses that could happen when the room-authority leaves.\n- Things attached to other things via Gizmos should no longer jitter/lag in Players' hands. Most cases of \"things lagging behind other things\" or jittering back and forth should be gone. Players can still jump around a bit due to network latency.\n- Fixed a bug where taking a new creator announcement photo cleared title and body text.\n- Fixed some incorrect reticle displays for ranged weapons.\n\nAs always, thanks for playing Rec Room!\n\nPlease see here for convenient links to controls, tutorials, comfort options, etc.: https://recroom.com/community\nWe love to hear your feedback, so please don't hesitate to let us know what you think...",

We were bombarded with insults and swears, we were banned and vote kicked for no reason, we were no mach for the army of little kid that got grounded from fortnight and stumbled upon this app. The devs released this game on consul. The community was ruined, the games were ransacked by toxic nine year olds who’s parents left them unmonitored and these kids don’t have any act-right. And finally, the game was ruined. Devs, please make it so vr players can only play with other vr players and consul players can only play with other consul players. MAKE THIS GAME AS AWESOME AS IT WAS BEFORE. \n\n\n    please.",
