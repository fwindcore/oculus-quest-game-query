				"change_log": "Rec Room UPDATE  - the \"Take a Seat\" edition\n\nWe've got an exciting one this week. You're gonna want to make sure you're sitting down for this...\n\nSince the dawn of gizmos ([and maybe even before](https://rec.net/room/roadtrip)), creators have been making rooms which put you in a vehicle and move you around. The classic trick, used [as far back as 2018](https://rec.net/room/coaster), was to keep the player in one place, and instead move the entire world around them. Things got a little easier once we added proper support for [moving platforms](https://www.reddit.com/r/RecRoom/comments/d04937/rec_room_update_the_stunt_runner_edition/), but it still hasn't quite been possible/easy to just sit the player down and move them around... until now!\n\n## Announcing Seats!\n\n- There's a new BETA Prop in the Maker Pen Pallette: The Seat. It's a small cushion that Players can interact with to be Seated onto stuff! It includes a CV2 Circuit Board that allows you to put players on or off of the Seat, as well as restrict them from manually getting on or off. Make sure to enable BETA objects in your room if you want to use the Seat prop!\n- Players can now \"sit\" on Seats on all platforms! This means:\n- When you grab a Seat cushion on chairs and couches, you'll be automatically transported to the Seat, at a reasonable height, and facing forward along the Seat's orientation.\n- While Seated, players' movements are restricted to stay within the Seat.\n- While Seated, players' bodies are rigidly attached to their Seat. If the Seat moves, rotates, tumbles, or goes upside-down, the seated player will go along for the ride!\n- All old chair-like Props (Chairs, Couches, Stools, etc.) have been upgraded to use the new Seated behavior. If you don't want that in your room, you can disable it through their Configuration menu with the Maker Pen.\n\n## General Improvements and Bug Fixes\n\n- We're working on giving creators the ability to create currencies inside their rooms. You may see some new beta chips/props related to currencies, but these are currently in closed beta while we work out the kinks - we're looking forward to making them available for everyone soon!\n- The following Circuits V2 chips have been moved out of beta:\n  - String Contains\n  - String Get Length\n  - String Split\n  - String Split at Index\n  - String Substring Index\n  - String To Lower\n  - String To Upper\n- The following Circuits V2 chips have been added to beta\n  - Angular Velocity Add\n  - Angular Velocity Set\n  - Player Left Hand Orientation\n  - Player Right Hand Orientation\n  - Quaternion Create Angle Axis\n  - Quaternion Create Euler Angles\n  - Quaternion Create From To\n  - Quaternion Create Look Rotation\n  - Quaternion Euler Angles\n  - Quaternion Inverse\n  - Quaternion Rotate Towards\n  - Quaternion Rotate Vector\n  - Quaternion Slerp\n- Fixed an issue where having too many CV2 wires in a room could cause them all to not render at all.\n- Club announcements now appear in the messages menu.\n- Fixed a rare crash with Sticky shapes.\n- Spatial audio now works correctly in SFX V2.\n- Fixed a bug where the UI would break in front of sparkle effects.\n- Fixed a bug on iOS where the number in the notification badge wasn't being reset properly.\n- Fixed default sorting for Play menu search results.\n- Fixed scrolling issues on the Play menu.\n- Fixed a bug where changing the sorting on some UI pages would cause a blank tile to appear.\n\nAs always, thanks for playing Rec Room!\n\nPlease see here for convenient links to controls, tutorials, comfort options, etc.: https://recroom.com/community\nWe love to hear your feedback, so please don't hesitate to let us know what you think...",
