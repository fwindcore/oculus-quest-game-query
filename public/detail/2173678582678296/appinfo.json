				"change_log": "Rec Room PATCH - the \"Take a Seat\" edition\n\n##Suggested Friend Invites\n\nTired of all the lame excuses your friends give you for not joining you in Rec Room? Well, we have now made it harder for them to resist! Now, iOS players can invite people from their contacts list and Steam / Xbox players can invite people from their platform friends list to join Rec Room with one click! [That's right, _just one click!_](https://imgur.com/a/RTawchR)\n\n- To access this feature, open your watch --> Home page --> Invite button on the top right corner.\n- The list will only show people who haven't played Rec Room yet. If your friend is not a Rec Room player but isn't on that list, you can still copy and share your link with them. We don't know why some don't show up, but hey, that's Rec Room for ya!\n- Friends who sign up for Rec Room using your invite will automatically get added as your Rec Room friend when they return to their Dorm after completing the tutorial. See? Their resistance was futile.\n\n\n## General Improvements and Bug Fixes\n\n- The Streaming Camera was previously only available for PC VR, but is now also available to Screens PC players with a second display -- no VR headset required! This was supposed to land with the streaming camera improvements, but a minor Unity upgrade broke it. Whoops! (At least Rec Room doesn't require focus again!)\n- AI from CV1 UGC Spawners will now properly despawn on Game End. No more zombie goblins _sad trombone_.\n- When objects manage to get below the ground in \\^RecCenter and Maker rooms, they will now return to their last spawn position instead of their last pickup position.\n- We fixed the bug in VR where doors wouldn't open if your hands were full, so now you don't have to put down your donuts to use a door. You're welcome! (who says we don't fix important bugs?)\n\nAs always, thanks for playing Rec Room!\n\nPlease see here for convenient links to controls, tutorials, comfort options, etc.: https://recroom.com/community\nWe love to hear your feedback, so please don't hesitate to let us know what you think...",
