The button has the same color as your current party color and links to the new Party tab on the People menu.\n- You can now restrict \"Voices I can hear\" to just party members.\n- The Go To button now detects existing party / game invites and consumes those if you have an existing one. Clicking Go To will just consume the invite and take you to whoever invited you instead of sending a new Go To request.\n\n## General Improvements\n\n- New watch menu UI is much more responsive and consistent on all platforms, even when running/falling/moving.\n- Lots more screens in the new UI style including RR+, keys, and token purchasing screens. In addition, we have a new and improved \"check out\" experience when you buy items.\n- Small buttons are more reliable to press.\n- Menu laser is more visible over light themed backgrounds.\n- Scrolling starts easier on screens when clicking and dragging.\n- Tool menus are partially improved with these changes (on screens, and VR while the menu is detached). We will make the menus better while attached to the tool soon!\n- Avatar customization menu is larger in VR.\n- We now preserve returning players mic settings through orientation.\n\nAs always, thanks for playing Rec Room!\n\nPlease see here for convenient links to controls, tutorials, comfort options, etc.: https://recroom.com/community\nWe love to hear your feedback, so please don't hesitate to let us know what you think...",

Roblox has the SAME kids, just... no mic! If you are looking for a child friendly, completely fun and games and happiness, this is not the game for you. This game is for people who enjoy having social experiences with amazing people who are supportive, and can deal with the occasional (mostly occasional) kids who don’t want you to have fun. \n\nPAY ATTENTION TO THIS: \n\nRec Room is not a game for the easily offended. It’s not a game for your precious child who you want to keep pure until they are teenagers. This IS a game for people looking for new experiences and are able to deal with the jerks and toxic kids in exchange for finding friends, having fun, and playing games.\n\nTo be honest, this game is my favorite game in Vr, and I am used to the good and bad. Ultimately you should get this game to play with friends, meet new ones, and to become more knowledgeable in what VR can be.\n\n______________________________________________",
