Gone are the days of watching a super-spy hero on-screen: by leveraging the head and hand-tracked capabilities of current VR technology, players can physically live out their 007 fantasies as the Espire Model 1 Operative. These stealth mechanics cannot be replicated on another medium. \n\nPlayers assume the role of an Espire Agent - a drone operator of the future. From the safety of their \"Espire Control Theatre\" (sized to their Oculus Guardian Boundaries) they deploy the Espire Model 1 operative on assignments around the globe. The player then remote-operates Espire 1 from thousands of Kilometres away - the player's movement is translated 1:1 into that of Espire.. The \"Control Theatre\" mechanic is not only a story component; it is used to minimize VR sickness whenever the player performs artificial movement.",

				"change_log": "Espire 1 v1.8 \"Spectre\" update. Full Release Notes for build 1.8.47:\n\n**New Features**\n- 2 new virtual challenges added to the game: 1) Furcata Hostage Rescue challenge 2) Mangua Takedown challenge\n- New Weapons: Spectre SMG + Sawn off Shotgun are now playable in the campaign\n- If players complete all of the SMG weapon challenges + all of the Sawn-Off shotgun weapon challenges, these 2 guns will be unlocked for the campaign.\n- Players will find the weapons sitting on a weapon rack close to the starting point for each mission.\n- These weapons are only available when playing a campaign mission on the Espire Agent (Normal) difficulty level\n- Updated the \"All weapons\" cheat to include the Spectre SMG and Sawn-off shotgun \n\n**UI Updates**\n- New \"Latest News\" UI panel added to the main menu to highlight new content to players. This will be updated with every feature update going forward.\n- The game’s end-credits have been updated to credit the team members and testers who have worked on Espire 1 since its initial release.\n\n**Bug Fixes and Enhancements**\n- AI Fixes/enhancements\n- Fixed an issue where enemy Soldiers no longer reacted to the player's hands. Now, guards will correctly spot the player’s hands if you’re using the hand-cams around a corner at close range to a guard!\n- Fixed an issue where enemy guards would not update their ‘perception component’ correctly. This reduces situations where enemies may spot the player at a glancing angle when they should not have\n- Fixed an issue where Enemies would say an incorrect voice line when discovering a knocked out ally, reporting the incident to their unit commander, and then waking up the ally.\n- Fixed an issue where dead/stunned hostages would appear to stand back up again after a period of time.\n- Fixed an issue where players could fall on the Jacobson (Destroyer) drone and ‘knock’ it out!\n\n**Crash Fixes**\n- Crash Fix: Fixed an issue where the game would become unresponsive if the player possessed an Espire unit while holding a weapon in their non-dominant hand. Thanks to the users who reported this issue and allowed us to narrow down the repro-steps. \n- Crash Fix: Fixed an issue where rarely, the game would crash during a ‘loading’ sequence in an airlock.\n\n**Achievements, Espire Trials, Completion-related**\n- Fixed an issue where an achievement related to collecting badges and trials will not be unlocked correctly. The player would have to replay a mission a 2nd time for the badge-count/trial-count achievement unlock to be reflected.  \n- Fixed an issue where if the player completes every trial, the associated achievement would not unlock correctly.\n- Increased the time limit requirement for the \"Feet don't fail me now” Espire Trial in mission 1.6 to reflect recent changes to the map that made it very, very difficult to complete under the original time limit. \n- Fixed an issue in Mission 1.5 where an E1FS Pistol was missing in the level, making the ‘weapon procurement’ badge for that mission unobtainable. \n- Fixed an issue where rarely, In one of the takedown challenges (Cinnamon), a particular enemy would spawn inside a wall, and the player would be unable to shoot them, making the challenge impossible to complete. \n- Fixed an issue where In mission 1.5 “Ventilation System”, there was a case where a major cinematic will not play and the player would have to restart the mission.\n\n**General Bug Fixes and changes**\n- Added plenty of ammo for the 2 secret cheat weapons \"Golden gun\" and \"Silver Serpent\", ensuring that if you use them in a campaign mission, there will be enough bullets.\n- Fixed in issue in mission 1.4 Data Centre where a weapon rack right near the start of the mission incorrectly had 3 copies of every pistol placed on it. \n- Fixed an issue in the game's first mission where, under certain circumstances, an area of the environment appeared jet black (not loading in).\n- Fixed an issue in the campaign where some weapons would sit at an incorrect orientation on the weapon racks found in airlocks\n- Fixed an issue where players would not correctly possess a new Espire unit if they happened to possess the unit while in the middle of climbing with their old Espire unit\n- Bullet logic (fired by the player and by enemies) was rewritten, improving performance\n\n**Updates to the Militaris Environment**\nThe “Militaris” environment has been updated for the 2 new challenges added in this 1.8 update. As part of this work, the following bugs were fixed:\n- Fixed an issue where tripmines in the Militaris Intel challenge were not being activated correctly\n- Fixed an issue where a corpse in the Militaris environment did not render correctly\n- Fixed an issue in the Militaris challenges where a player could ‘throw themselves’ out of bounds.\n- Fixed an issue in the Militaris environment where players could climb so high that they could see’ out of world’\n",

We’ve pushed a quick hotfix for the current v1.5 version of Espire that fixes some issues reported by users since release of the update:\n\n- Fixed an issue with Leaderboards where the “My Rank” button was not correctly showing the user’s rank in some circumstances.\n\n- Adjusted the PAR time, cost and expenditure targets for some virtual challenges based on user feedback.  Some targets were too difficult or easy. \nThey’ve now been adjusted as follows:\n- Hold-Up #2 Togah Expenditure PAR: Decreased from 10000 to 2745\n- Hold-Up #3 Silver Expenditure PAR: Decreased from 7500 to 3000\n- Hold-Up #3 Silver Combined Score PAR: Increased from 4000 to 8000\n- Hold-Up #5 Stellata Combined Score PAR: Increased from 2500 to 9600\n- Hostage #2 Mira Expenditure PAR: Increased from 2500 to 25000\n- Note that to see these new scores reflected in the UI, you’ll have to play the challenge once.\n\n- Fixed an issue where the option to disable the \"HUD Helmet lines\" was not being saved in the user’s save file, so they would have to disable this feature on every play session.\n- Fixed a level streaming issue in Mission 1.3 Research Sector. The \"Lecture Hall\" area would not load if the player visited it after going through a nearby vent system loading trigger.\n- Fixed a level streaming issue in Mission 1.6 Basement level 1. The \"Storage area\" would not load correctly if the player visited it after going through a nearby vent system.\n\nWe have also added a feature:\n- Players can now ‘cancel’ a forced Espire Instinct Slo-Mo event by pressing the Instinct button.\n\nWe’ve been working hard on our next major update for Espire and look forward to sharing news about it with you ahead of its release. If you’re enjoying Espire, we’d appreciate you leaving a review to share your thoughts.\n\nWe’re also on Discord - join us at discord.gg/Espire1. Thanks for supporting the game!",

							"reviewDescription": "We looked this game up on Steam first to check out some videos and screenshots etc and were concerned to find the game had only mixed reviews. We were hoping to have a different experience, and luckily, we did! Espire 1 can be described as having Metal Gear Solid and Hitman influences, with some strong Robocop/Terminator vibes. Your role as a Spy is to take control of a mechanical operative via Virtual Reality (yes, this is VR inside VR!) to traverse and complete objectives in various areas, all while either remaining fully undetected or by gunning down all the threats.\n\nMovement in-game has been fine-tuned to reduce sickness, but for those with VR legs of steel, full locomotion is beautifully implemented. For those who have played classic Metal Gear Solid or to an extent, Hitman, will understand the stealth mechanics used instantly. Stay out of sight, remain quiet (literally), or face detection followed by a shower of incoming bullets raining down on you. You have the use of futuristic spy technology at your disposal and can tranquilise and drag enemies to darkened corridors to prevent guards from being alerted to your presence. It feels good to clear a space that was once swarming with guards and security without a single eye laying its, eye, on you.\n\nWhat the game did leave us with was the sadness that it didn’t last all that long, if you’re good on your feet, can solve the odd puzzle and can aim a weapon pretty well, you’ll be done in just a number of hours. However, there are side objectives that you can complete by replaying missions and high scores to compete for that could easily increase the game’s length by at least a few more hours. Another positive is that the graphics are solid, easily some of the best the Quest has to offer, although texture-popping can be noticed at times. Generally, the game is a nice change of pace and a welcome addition to the Quest line-up.\n\nRead the full review here: https://www.opiumpulses.com/article/420/",

								"body": "Hi! First and foremost thanks ever so much for deciding to check us out. We're very humbled you considered us and decided to try our game out to feature and review. :) Secondly thanks for taking the time to actually write and leave us a review, we really do appreciate it and it's fantastic to see your curiosity was rewarded with a great experience. :) You absolutely hit the nail on the head when you mentioned metal gear, most of us here at Digital Lode are passionate about that genre of games and we took heavy inspiration from legendary stealth action titles such as that when developing Espire. We aimed to take various aspects of what made those games so awesome to play, most notably the stealth mechanics and use that idea to develop our own stealth abilities combined with our unique concept and story all within a VR environment. By the way as a side note it's also great to see you understood our concept of inception with the whole VR within VR ideology. :) We are however sorry to hear you felt the game was a little short in terms of the main campaign however do have additional aspects within the game that can increase replayability which you may have accidentally bypassed, particularly in regards to unlockables. First off you did touch on this briefly was the ability to unlock cheats through side missions. These side missions are known as Espire trials. They don't only add replayability but they also range from being relatively simplistic (taking out all security cameras on mission 1.1 as an example) to extremely difficult (finishing and completing mission 1.6 on VR operative difficulty in under 5:30 being the main example) so it also adds that challenge element to the game as well as a sense of further completion. We also have badges on each mission which can be unlocked. These consist of traversing through the mission without: getting spotted, killing anyone, engaging in combat, or repairing yourself, the 5th badge is an all in one badge which you get for doing all of these in one run. Again like the trials there are certain missions where this is a lot easier than others so gives you added challenge and replayability. If you also manage to achieve every badge in every mission on VR operative difficulty you'll also unlock a badge collector achievement which is a platform achievement for our game on oculus, playstation and steam. Finally we also have a gun procurement system whereby you can collect firearms on each mission. We placed some of these purposefully in some obscure places within the mission maps and some in easier locations (plus you generally have the guns you can procure from just taking a guard out and grabbing their weapon) so it acts as a kind of treasure hunt aspect to a degree. To procure successfully you have to finish the mission with the gun equipped or attached to your holster or chest so 5 at a time in any one run can be procured. (2 in your hands, 2 in your holster and 1 on your chest) We hope that sheds a little more light into some added replayability. Thanks once again for checking us out and featuring us in your reviews not to mention your website. We checked you guys out briefly and what you do is awesome so keep it up. :) Thanks for playing!",
