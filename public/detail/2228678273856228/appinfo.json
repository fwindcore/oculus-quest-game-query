			"display_long_description": "**Now including our 1.7 Anniversary Update with enhancements for Quest 1 & 2 users.**\n\nWith Espire 1, we're delivering VR's definitive Stealth Experience. Gone are the days of watching a super-spy hero on-screen: by leveraging the head and hand-tracked capabilities of current VR technology, players can physically live out their 007 fantasies as the Espire Model 1 Operative. These stealth mechanics cannot be replicated on another medium. \n\nPlayers assume the role of an Espire Agent - a drone operator of the future. From the safety of their \"Espire Control Theatre\" (sized to their Oculus Guardian Boundaries) they deploy the Espire Model 1 operative on assignments around the globe. The player then remote-operates Espire 1 from thousands of Kilometres away - the player's movement is translated 1:1 into that of Espire.. The \"Control Theatre\" mechanic is not only a story component; it is used to minimize VR sickness whenever the player performs artificial movement.",

							"body_text": "Attention Espire Agents! We hope you’re enjoying our recently released version 1.5 content update. We’ve pushed a quick hotfix for the current v1.5 version of Espire that fixes some issues reported by users since release of the update:\n\n- Fixed an issue with Leaderboards where the “My Rank” button was not correctly showing the user’s rank in some circumstances.\n\n- Adjusted the PAR time, cost and expenditure targets for some virtual challenges based on user feedback.  Some targets were too difficult or easy. \nThey’ve now been adjusted as follows:\n- Hold-Up #2 Togah Expenditure PAR: Decreased from 10000 to 2745\n- Hold-Up #3 Silver Expenditure PAR: Decreased from 7500 to 3000\n- Hold-Up #3 Silver Combined Score PAR: Increased from 4000 to 8000\n- Hold-Up #5 Stellata Combined Score PAR: Increased from 2500 to 9600\n- Hostage #2 Mira Expenditure PAR: Increased from 2500 to 25000\n- Note that to see these new scores reflected in the UI, you’ll have to play the challenge once.\n\n- Fixed an issue where the option to disable the \"HUD Helmet lines\" was not being saved in the user’s save file, so they would have to disable this feature on every play session.\n- Fixed a level streaming issue in Mission 1.3 Research Sector. The \"Lecture Hall\" area would not load if the player visited it after going through a nearby vent system loading trigger.\n- Fixed a level streaming issue in Mission 1.6 Basement level 1. The \"Storage area\" would not load correctly if the player visited it after going through a nearby vent system.\n\nWe have also added a feature:\n- Players can now ‘cancel’ a forced Espire Instinct Slo-Mo event by pressing the Instinct button.\n\nWe’ve been working hard on our next major update for Espire and look forward to sharing news about it with you ahead of its release. If you’re enjoying Espire, we’d appreciate you leaving a review to share your thoughts.\n\nWe’re also on Discord - join us at discord.gg/Espire1. Thanks for supporting the game!",

And if you want to get a good laugh out of this game just grab a chair and wail someone in the head with it. I started dying laughing when I realized I can whack enemies with chairs. Now the chair is my favorite weapon. Now I have a suggestion for the game. Make the game have a mode where they put you in a random place, random guns, and random enemies scattered around this random map. This would be soooo cool. I’m getting sick of playing the same 6 missions over and over and over again. I’m getting really bored of this. This suggestion makes it different every time. There is different enemies every time, different guns, and different objectives every time so we have a new thing to do every time. I don’t think any vr quest game has ever done this and this would be literally the best game now. Please add this :D",

Thanks ever so much for the extremely awesome and positive review! :) We're pleased you love all the aspects about the game particularly the ability to use the environment as a weapon such as grabbing chairs lol! It made us laugh when we read that. Awesome stuff! :) We really appreciate the suggestion however it's doubtful we'll be adding newer modes to the game unfortunately. We do however have more content planned on the way soon so stay tuned for that. Regarding the graphics we're pleased you like them and we're happy to confirm there's a quest 2 update coming anytime now which will increase the visual quality and performance. :) This will also however reflect marginally on the quest 1 as well as all other platforms we're based on due to a game engine upgrade so rest assured if you only own the quest 1 you should get an update anytime now. :) Thanks again for the awesome review and the suggestion. :) Hope you continue to have fun and taking copperhead guard's heads off with chairs lol. :) Thanks for playing!",
