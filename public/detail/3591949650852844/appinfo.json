This leaves Zero Caliber Reloaded feeling like a strange game that's stuck between eras, the AI & visuals remind me of Goldeneye/classic N64 era shooters but the impressive gunplay & the way you interact with the tools of destruction at your fingertips feel like some of the most impressive shooting on the Quest... \n\nUltimately I've had a tonne of fun everytime I've loaded up Zero Caliber on the Quest, the multiplayer is a real high point and being able to blast through levels with a couple of friends whilst throwing each other different guns & attachments to try is a real treat.\n\nIf you're looking for a campaign driven, co-op, military shooter for the Quest then Zero Caliber will likely keep you entertained but go in prepared for wonky AI, some throwback visuals & a healthy handful of bugs (most of which are pretty hilarious)\n\nQuest 2 Gameplay - https://youtu.be/ECVDpa5dkrE",
