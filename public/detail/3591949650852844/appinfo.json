							"reviewDescription": "I wish I could give this one 3.5 out of 4, its definitely better than a 3 out of 5 but I'm not sure its all the way worth 4 out of 5...its a tough one!\n\nZero Caliber Reloaded does a great job of transferring the incredibly enjoyable gun mechanics, modular attachments & physics fun over to the Quest platform but it does so at the high cost of the visuals that the fully fledged PC VR version has. This leaves Zero Caliber Reloaded feeling like a strange game that's stuck between eras, the AI & visuals remind me of Goldeneye/classic N64 era shooters but the impressive gunplay & the way you interact with the tools of destruction at your fingertips feel like some of the most impressive shooting on the Quest... \n\nUltimately I've had a tonne of fun everytime I've loaded up Zero Caliber on the Quest, the multiplayer is a real high point and being able to blast through levels with a couple of friends whilst throwing each other different guns & attachments to try is a real treat.\n\nIf you're looking for a campaign driven, co-op, military shooter for the Quest then Zero Caliber will likely keep you entertained but go in prepared for wonky AI, some throwback visuals & a healthy handful of bugs (most of which are pretty hilarious)\n\nQuest 2 Gameplay - https://youtu.be/ECVDpa5dkrE",
