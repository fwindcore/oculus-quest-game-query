							"reviewDescription": "I dropped a good 10 hours into this game and wanted to play it with my children.  We get them a quest and link the account to mine since I don’t allow them to have Facebook.  We go to play together and the game kicks off the first user.  I’m not going to go into a long sob story on this, but I will try and frame it for the developer.  When we have guests over and their kids want to play games with mine they turn on Mario kart and you know what happens we get a call from them sometimes asking for Nintendo user name so they can play online with my boys.  Imagine all the other people this happens too.  Too often VR is seen as puzzles or shooting games or gory games.  Games like this are easily overlooked when honestly after playing this Mario cart can’t compare.  I hope you guys fix this really soon.  I understand the appeal of one user one headset only, but when a game like this blocks themselves from being easily accessible to groups it’s really sad.  It doesn’t even have to be online gameplay just local multiple headsets.  This game is better than Mario cart, but with a limiting set up like this it may never take off.  The four star is proof that I truly believe this game is good, but until you allow for multiple headsets per account I cannot go higher.  If you want a great racing game that is not bad on motion sickness this is it.  The game is solid minus that one gripe about local multiple headsets.",
