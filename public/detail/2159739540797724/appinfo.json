Let me explain.\n\nThis game can and will be improved. However, it has everything you need to enjoy playing VR comfortably installed in your chair.\n\nI am not a big lazy guy but i also know that VR sessions can be very tiring so the gametime is physicaly limited. However with this game you can play comfortably sitted and remains fully immersive. In fact it is more immersive to be sitted.\n\nThere are many cosmectics, weapons and they recently improved graphics & performance with two new tracks.\n\nFrequent updates, solid base & great ambitions such as becoming the VR kart game reference.\n\nThis game is not perfect but it has EVERYTHING you need to enjoy playing VR while drifting, shotting, throwing things... \n\nDrift is the Key by the way. ;)\n\nConclusion: JUST BUY IT\n\nA few things that needs to be improved in my opinion:\n-lobby interaction is broken (Other's people moves looks weird)\n-Engines needs to be balanced in order to handle harder Track such as Volcanic Jungle and even more to be able to drift on all the maps.\n-Poison/Hack needs to be reduce because it can break a perfect run & let you loose even if you were ahead from far.
