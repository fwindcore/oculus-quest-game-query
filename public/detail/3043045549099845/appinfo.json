After a successful December update, we got straight to work on more of the features YOU have been asking for.\n\nToday, our Star Shaman Balancing Update has arrived and it will introduce Shamans old and new to a more welcoming galaxy.\n\nBALANCING ADJUSTMENTS\nShamans, we heard you loud and clear about the difficulty of our solar systems. You will now see that the combat is a bit easier, and shorter. Also, every time you regenerate a planet, your health is now refilled, so you can breathe a little more after a challenging level.\n\nBOSS CHECKPOINT MODE\nIn this game mode, your progression will be saved once you defeat a Boss - no more starting the game over when you die in solar system 2 or 3. We’ve kept a classic mode for Shamans who revel in the original challenge of the game.\n\nA NEW OFFENSIVE SPELL\nYou can now unlock a new spell, the Carom. It’s a rippling shot which damages your target and the nemies nearby, like a ricochet.\n\n\n\nACHIEVEMENTS\n11 original achievements help you track your progress in the game.\n\nGRAPHIC REFRESH\nWe have added 14 new moons and you will be delighted to see the skies have been improved.\n\nAll these additions will give you more time for multiple runs to explore new combos, play styles and everything our galaxy has to offer.\n\nHurry Shaman! Adventure awaits!\nDon’t forget; the Universe is counting on you.",

							"body_text": "Greetings Shaman\n\nHere at Lunar Grove we have been circling the galaxy in preparation for your next voyage. We are incredibly grateful for all the initial feedback we received on the game. Please don’t stop sharing. We love hearing from you.\n\nToday, Star Shaman 2.0 is released and with it comes some big changes.\n\nA stronger sense of character progression. Weapons and perks now unlock in the Reliquary during the game instead of when you die. In addition, each time you die, perks and persistent spells will be added to your Shaman Sphere for your next run, giving you more strength for your return. Additionally, respawning now grants you more money.\n\nIn this update, we've managed to trade 3 new spells with the Kybele:\n•    Beam: Hold trigger to channel it towards enemies.\n•    Nova: Stun/Fry hand-thrown grenade.\n•    Jolt Daemon: A jolt-firing entity to fight alongside you for a limited time.\n\nYou will notice a reworked HUD (Heads-Up-Display) where it is easier to check your hit points and current score.\n\nFellow Shamans are also getting a beautiful 90Hz refresh rate on Quest 2.\n\nBe on the lookout for 15 new moons.\n\nThe tutorial has been entirely reworked thanks to your feedback. You will see it is shorter and more fluid to move through. It also emphasizes the use of both hands as using the shield is key to your success. You will notice how parrying an incoming projectile now translates into an additional charge on your attack wand!\n\nYour space traveling has sped up! The tunnels are shorter from planet to planet making your time traveling through space more dynamic.\n\nEvery character has its own distinct voice, and our favorite mentor Heidi is now speaking English when the Astral Teleporter allows it.\n\nFinally, fellow Shamans speaking Spanish, Italian, Japanese or Chinese can join in on the fun. That’s 7 languages supported!\n\nNow go, Shaman.\nThe Universe is counting on you!",

The visuals are spectacular and the music is highly original. I'll admit I spent the first ten minutes trying to wrap my head around everything that was going on in the intro, but once I got my bearing I had a ton of fun with it. \n\nIt's got incredible potential as further development continues on it to become something that truly stands out in the niche and guides things for the better. The devs are very responsive on Discord and always looking for feedback on how to improve the game, something you don't always see. It's a shame this is an unknown gem on the Oculus Store as it's one that I truly think should be highlighted more often. Do yourself a favor and check this game out. You won't regret it.",
