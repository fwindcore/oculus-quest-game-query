							"body_text": "CELEBRATION UPDATE\n\nToday is the 6-month anniversary of the release of Star Shaman!\nWe're incredibly proud to have built a game shared and enjoyed by thousands of people in the world! And there's a ton more things to say about it - from launching our soundtrack to attending Raindance to following our first Speedrun contest. All of this fantastic journey thanks to our players!\n\n\n\nWhen you have such a great community, you want to give back: we're releasing today our latest update, featuring many additions that make the game longer, smoother, more enjoyable - in a word, better. \nWe hope you enjoy it as much as we do.\n\nDIFFICULTY LEVELS\nThe game now features 3 difficulty levels, which you select when starting a NEW GAME:\n- EASY replenishes your health gauge after each planet you revive,\n- MEDIUM gives you only 3 hearts back,\n- HARD gives you only 1 heart back (in EASY mode, Events that used to provide Health will now give you BioSeqs).\n\nREWORKED ENEMY BATCHES\nThe new enemy scaling and batches provide a smoother difficulty curve between solar systems. It is now possible - for seasoned players - to start the game fresh in either CLASSIC or BOSS CHECKPOINT MODE and finish it in a single run.\n\nBETTER SPELL ACCESSIBILITY\nSpellcasting gestures have been reworked so they are less wide and high, accommodating shorter or younger players.\n\nSPEEDRUN TIMER\nYou can now time your run with a specific chronometer displayed in the bottom left corner of your HUD. You can activate it in the options menu BEFORE you start or continue a run. This is especially useful for Let's Play or Contests with video capture.\n\nAND MUCH MORE:\n- You are now able to skip the tutorial when you start a NEW GAME.\n- Player progression is now fully displayed when you die, so you know what's coming ahead to help you in your journey.\n- Weapon damages and ammunition have been revisited, providing a better variety of use.\n- The START button now correctly displays START when you launch the game for the first time.",

After a successful December update, we got straight to work on more of the features YOU have been asking for.\n\nToday, our Star Shaman Balancing Update has arrived and it will introduce Shamans old and new to a more welcoming galaxy.\n\nBALANCING ADJUSTMENTS\nShamans, we heard you loud and clear about the difficulty of our solar systems. You will now see that the combat is a bit easier, and shorter. Also, every time you regenerate a planet, your health is now refilled, so you can breathe a little more after a challenging level.\n\nBOSS CHECKPOINT MODE\nIn this game mode, your progression will be saved once you defeat a Boss - no more starting the game over when you die in solar system 2 or 3. We’ve kept a classic mode for Shamans who revel in the original challenge of the game.\n\nA NEW OFFENSIVE SPELL\nYou can now unlock a new spell, the Carom. It’s a rippling shot which damages your target and the nemies nearby, like a ricochet.\n\n\n\nACHIEVEMENTS\n11 original achievements help you track your progress in the game.\n\nGRAPHIC REFRESH\nWe have added 14 new moons and you will be delighted to see the skies have been improved.\n\nAll these additions will give you more time for multiple runs to explore new combos, play styles and everything our galaxy has to offer.\n\nHurry Shaman! Adventure awaits!\nDon’t forget; the Universe is counting on you.",

The visuals are spectacular and the music is highly original. I'll admit I spent the first ten minutes trying to wrap my head around everything that was going on in the intro, but once I got my bearing I had a ton of fun with it. \n\nIt's got incredible potential as further development continues on it to become something that truly stands out in the niche and guides things for the better. The devs are very responsive on Discord and always looking for feedback on how to improve the game, something you don't always see. It's a shame this is an unknown gem on the Oculus Store as it's one that I truly think should be highlighted more often. Do yourself a favor and check this game out. You won't regret it.",
