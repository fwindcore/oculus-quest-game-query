							"reviewDescription": "But....the toxicity and kids are DESTROYING it. I know its hard to completely control this situation, but SOMETHING needs to be done. I can hardly enter a lobby or match anymore without hearing a 10-15 year old cussing adults out, being racist, being sexist, being rude and demeaning, etc. I got told last night by a CHILD that i need to \"go die from cancer\" and that i'm a \"piece of s**t\", then got harrassed the whole rest of the match by him and another CHILD. I recorded and reported, as i have with others, and will continue to do so...but you gotta do something about this. I have developed an extreme liking for this game, and i'd like to enjoy it and be able to tell others about it to play as well, but its becoming harder and harder every day to want to tell others to come and try to enjoy such an amazing game, that has the MOST toxicity i've almost ever encountered in any game. Up until lately, i know this is not the devs fault...but we HAVE SPOKEN. PLEASE! Figure this out! Hell. I, myself, would PAY and SHOW ID to be in a 18 or 21+ lobby. I also recently realized that the matchmaking isn't decided by which lobby you are in, correct? Because, if it's not already, keep the match making lobby-specific....or/also maybe create a NEW lobby with tighter restrictions of SOME sort. Maybe add more moderators? I never see mods or Dev's. Ever. Take people like me (not necessarily saying me, but i would do it) and give them more capabilities than others...like, ability to boot and report toxicity. The mods (have a TON of them. Again, i will do it. Lol) should be able to temporarily kick a toxic player and report them. And, of course, to prevent toxic mods or anyone taking advantage of the \"power position\", have a zero-tolerence policy for false-reporting. Problem solved. :) please. Do something! Thank you.",
