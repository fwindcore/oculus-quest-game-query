Before depending on when you got the sensor reading it could be 4 ms in the past or 1 ms in the past now it's always predicted to current time. \nDisc Curve has been added as an option on the Private Match Podium. \nThe moderated lobby pop-up dialogue only needs to be accepted once per play session and not every time you enter a community moderated Social Lobby. \nThe Follow Cam now follows the player more smoothly instead of following the disc. \nVOIP quality has been improved when a player is experiencing degraded network conditions.

Seriously why is it called echo?  I'm sure I'm in good company when i say i spent a hundred or more dollars in games before finding echo and here i lay with sore arms being the only reason I'm not playing echo right now.  Its so hard to put down. Laughed so hard and made many friends this game is sooooooooooooooo much fun. Must have. Few key points though\n\n1 don't let the kids fool you there are good tweens and middle schoolers that offer better competition than the plentiful adults i meet. \n\n2 USE THE BIGGEST SPACE YOU CAN FIND IN YOUR HOUSE... WRIST STRAPS. All precautions should be taken sadly mine were implemented after the fact. I now have a makeshift foot barrier and play in the garage... I STILL FELL INTO A BIKE... but it's totally worth it.... \n\n3 practice your shot\n\n4... GET THIS GAME",
