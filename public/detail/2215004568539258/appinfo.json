Before depending on when you got the sensor reading it could be 4 ms in the past or 1 ms in the past now it's always predicted to current time. \nDisc Curve has been added as an option on the Private Match Podium. \nThe moderated lobby pop-up dialogue only needs to be accepted once per play session and not every time you enter a community moderated Social Lobby. \nThe Follow Cam now follows the player more smoothly instead of following the disc. \nVOIP quality has been improved when a player is experiencing degraded network conditions.

							"reviewDescription": "I didn‚Äôt even really read the description for Echo when I downloaded it. I skimmed several games and tried to put an assortment of entertainment for my bf, as well as our 8yo and 5yo. The game sat untouched for way too long... I opened it bored one evening and have barely been able to make myself share the VR üòÇüòÇ\n\nI‚Äôm obsessed. I‚Äôve put my ~75yo parents on this game. I‚Äôm shoving it onto my friends. If you like competition, even if you hate frisbee as much as I do, GET THIS. GET IT RFN.\n\nultimate frisbee + zero gravity + full contact sport \n\nDescription should read ‚ÄúTalk smack & punch mfkrs in the head to stun them and steal the stupid robo-disc.‚Äù\n\nSay no more, I‚Äôm in!\n\nMAKE SURE YOU GIVE YOURSELF PLENTY OF ROOM FOR THIS ONE. The more the better. The matches can get fast-paced with committed teammates, and it‚Äôs easy to lose track of where you‚Äôre standing. \n\nMaybe even put some tape down if you‚Äôve got ADHD af kids so they can see the boundary and know it‚Äôs an off limits area when someone is playing... bc my 5yo son totally walked WAY too close and I just BAP BAP BAP right into his head üòÇüòÇ poor dude.\n\nI‚Äôm not even mad. 10/10 for Echo VR. A must have. So immersive, I sometimes forget when I take the headset off that I am not as weightless as I thought.\n\n‚Äî‚Äî SUGGESTIONS FOR DEVS ‚Äî‚Äî\n\n‚Ä¢ I‚Äôd like to see a way to add people from the random matches instead of the squeaker kids in the lobby.. the matches I‚Äôve played have been great, and I hate to see the match end and not be able to link back up and play with the ppl I have good chemistry with during a match. The match ends, I wind up back in the lobby with no way to go back and find the ppl I just brought the W home with.\n\n‚Ä¢ Before the actual match starts, maybe a little huddle time for the respective teams to strategize and come up with a play for the match. Something longer than just 15 seconds. It‚Äôs a team competitive match, I‚Äôd like to be able to exercise some teamwork before the match, bc during the match it moves fast and everyone is talking over each other.\n\n‚Ä¢ A filter to select an age range to play with. I love kids, I‚Äôve got four of them myself.. but I‚Äôd like to play with some ppl my age who would like to strategize and really go for gold on games.",
