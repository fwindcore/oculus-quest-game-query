							"reviewDescription": "The game itself and the concept is very fun to play and exhilarating it can become addictive and very competitive the reason why I’m rating it one star is because of the toxic people that play the game has ruined it for me.. I’m tired of the jacking off gestures and other sexual gestures I’m tired of the loser sign being implemented after the round is over and I have lost and they have one it’s poor sportsmanship like that that ruins the game for me and that’s why I much prefer just to play single player games that are off-line because people nowadays are sick and it really ruins the experience if I was the creator I would remove the hands completely to minimize the toxicity that this game has in it..Remove the hands ... don’t give people the option to do the gestures in the first place and it won’t be a problem....\n\nUPDATE.... I have changed my rating from one star to five star.. The reason being is because the developers reached out to me and are looking into the problem to better serve the game and create a better atmosphere for all players and all age levels... it’s not the developers fault for the poor sportsmanship or the misconduct or the toxic players that play the game... \n\nI love the competition of this game I love the strategy that is involved to be good at this game but come on people because we really are all playing on the same team we’re all playing the game to win we’re all playing the game because we enjoy it let’s not take that away from other players😊 play on!",
