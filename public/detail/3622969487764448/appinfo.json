It also gives you arcade thrills with Time Attack mode. All of this is soaked in delicious dieselpunk sauce. \n\n* Indiana Jones-like navigation where you use grappling hooks and boosters? It's like a jam and peanut butter combination \n* Campaign with over 50 levels, wacky plot and a dose of slavic humour and dad jokes; \n* Everyone loves environmental puzzles, we have them! \n* Time attack mode where you swing through 20 arcade levels and with leaderboards \n* List of energetic and atmospheric tracks;\n* Unique dieselpunk-in-space vibe; \n* Easy to learn! - you need only two minutes to swing.",

A large mostly open zone with some floating structures to grapple onto, some place to get more used to the controls than just the tutorial zone. This is a great game but I feel like the mechanics are kind of wasted without a large open zone to REALLY mess around and have fun with the grapples.  Thank you for reading :)",
