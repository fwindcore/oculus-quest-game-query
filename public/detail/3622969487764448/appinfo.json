Very fun. \n\nLasts quite awhile, it's a big station. And after you finish the game there are tons of time challenges for swinging through specially created courses. And they add new ones in updates.\n\nAn extremely fun game, especially once you figure out that whole arm pulls will whiz you upwards! Very intuitive, very Spiderman.",
