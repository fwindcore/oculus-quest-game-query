Please use the in-game reporting system for any underage players or trolls as we do weekly bans based on them. Also, higher stakes cash games and any level Spin & Go's and Sit & Go's should have more serious poker players. Lastly, you can use the ‘Mute Remote’, found in your Utilities menu of your left joystick to mute any disruptive players and their props.  These types of players are being removed daily and you can also record video clips of these incidents.  Once recorded, reach out to one of the community managers (Jordan, Eyan, Gouge) in our server at Discord.gg/PokerStarsVR and they can collect your report and take swift action.  Thank you",
