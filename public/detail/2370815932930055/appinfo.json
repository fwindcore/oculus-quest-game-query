False reviews bashing the game and development team and saying the development team is lazy, is the furthest thing from the truth that has ever been presented to us. It is a privilege to be on our server and we have the right to remove anyone at anytime for violating our TOS and Code Of Conduct.\") This was a comment from the devs. I won't lie I do love this game and while i do not think the game is rigged everything else was a lie. the game is extremely buggy, consistently crashes, the community is toxic, fails to load lobby's frequently, and there has been update after update with no issues being fixed. so far the only update that i've liked where I saw a change is the report system. the games biggest issue is the under age players on the game. a bunch of kids every single day that probably don't even like poker find a free game, download it, then join the lobby's playing with toys and chip dumping. me and most of the community i've talked to, feels like the issue would be fixed by simply just making the game $2. but for the most part the game is a good game, far better than the other poker game, just need a solution for chip dumping and underage players. toxic players can just be muted, and the bugs actually need to be fixed. UPDATE: the game is definitely rigged in the favor of the people who spend money on game. UPDATE I played 20 hands and lost them all while one player won 17 out of 20 leaving the rest of us with nothing. with the amount of items the player had he has so obviously spent money on the game. I've spent over 600,000 on slots and have gotten nothing from it. the game is rigged and I have deleted it.\nUPDATE the funny thing is the devs will just come up with some back handed response to this review denying my claims, instead of acknowledge is and actually fix the issues bc they do not care. they only care about making money. I will also probably be banned.",
