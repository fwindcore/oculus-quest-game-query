							"reviewDescription": "I have hundreds of hours in this game. Maybe thousands haha. It’s a great social experience! Unfortunately the new update is pretty bad with weird looking new avatars (subjective) and an ABUNDANT amount of bugs. I’ve always enjoyed the table talk but that’s about it. \n\nAs far as poker goes, there’s clearly a system or algorithm in place that is designed to promote action at the table. This may make for some fun, but in turn it makes for very unrealistic poker hands to occur very consistently in regards to real poker. So be prepared for a LOT of bad beats! That being said there’s still room to bluff and make real poker plays, but don’t expect the statistics to be that anywhere near the real deal. \n\nThe game crashes frequently on the quest 2. \nAlmost every time I launch the game I have to quit and restart (sometimes I’m lucky enough to get the game running on the first try). When I finally do get the game to launch, it’s troublesome to connect to tables. The game menu is generally blank or it fails to connect to the servers. But after a few refreshes it will eventually work. \n\nOverall the game is fun and is worth the free download but can be frustrating at times. If you want a great social experience I would highly suggest! But If you’re a poker player looking to expand your skills or get some practice in, maybe just stick to the real poker tables.",
