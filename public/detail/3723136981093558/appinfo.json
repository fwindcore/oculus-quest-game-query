			"display_long_description": "This is the opening act of the story of the Paper Birds, a 20 minute experience that will transport you to the invisible world of intuition and creativity: The source of inspiration for all musicians.\n \nToto, a child with an exceptional talent for music, must find his way through the darkness to bring back his sister, taken away by the great shadow. Follow him as you step into a miniature toy-like town to confront his grandfather and reveal the truth about the mystery of the Paper Birds.\n \nThis is neither a movie nor a video game. Paper Birds combines narrative storytelling with light interactivity. Using your hands through the hand tracking feature, you’ll paint light over sound and open portals to the mystical land of darkness. \n\nStarring Archie Yates from “Jojo Rabbit” and the upcoming revival of “Home Alone,” this experience is brought to you by the creators of Gloomy Eyes. \n \nThe second and closing act will be available mid 2021.\n",

So no complaints on shortness. The animation and music are superb.   The narration is good but the story seemed off… the grandma was not mourning the loss?!  Don’t want to spoil anything.  I wish there was more sparkles when I used my hands and there were parts where I expected to be sparkles but instead I got the circle and square which pulled me out of the movie.  Lastly the quest 2 really is poor at black scenes I didn’t realize this till I played the game… it felt like I was in a gray fuzzy place…lots of the time. The only time you think you see black is when there’s more light in the scene which happened in the last 20 per cent of the movie… I hope the developers have learned from this and cont in that direction and later go back to this one and add some more light sources to mask the limitations of quest 2.  I wish I saw this on quest 1.  5 dollars is very little to go on this journey… I am glad to support the artists and musicians involved I give that amount as a tip to bartenders spend far less time on my drink.",
