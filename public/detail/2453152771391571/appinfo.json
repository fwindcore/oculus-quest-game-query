It’s still fun and no regrets. \nI played this alone on the oculus set my boyfriend gave me for Christmas, and it was a blast and easy for a clumsy newbie!\nIt was so fun I had him download to his set for a distanced date night. \nThe multiplayer was difficult to figure out because getting back into the tutorials after the initial intro is buried a bit ... but once we figured it out it was really fun to dance cooperatively and compete in a private room. \nWe never did figure out how to customize our avatars and it’s hilarious that we were both black androgynous characters when in real life he’s Asian and I’m pale white. Dancing together was really fun (we met during the pandemic and we have not actually danced together in person).  \nThis was more fun and interactive than most other non-shooter social games. Alone or with someone else it’s a great workout. Dancing is just fun and happy. \nI would give 5 stars if these issues were resolved: \n1. More music, love the classic 80s and 90s!\n2. Avatar customization would make this an even better pandemic date night. I would pay for outfit upgrades. \n3. A more intuitive help system... even a character in the room to ask questions to.",
