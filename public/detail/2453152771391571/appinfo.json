							"reviewDescription": "This one is partially totally what we expected, and on the other hand an utter surprise! Dance Central is a long-standing and popular dancing game published by Microsoft and isn’t one new to motion controls as various titles in the franchise have been released that take advantage of the Xbox’s Kinect sensor. The 32 included music tracks are popular and relevant, not particularly our taste in OP but they'll likely be enjoyed by the target audience.\n\nIn this one you are based in what appears to be a dance club and can move from room to room meeting dancers and staff at the club, learning new moves and getting contact details so that you can arrange to dance with them when you like. The visual style is odd and a little off-putting, almost like you’re dancing with PS2 era Rock Band characters, but not without an element of charm and personality. Your own character customisation is very limited with what seemed like a gender-neutral system, which on paper is fine, but for those of us who very much have no problem sticking with our default biological gender, I was never fully comfortable with how my avatar ended up looking - a shame as Rock Band avatars are awesome!\n\nWhile the dancing doesn’t feel completely authentic without full-body tracking (it really only tracks your hands and head) and the idea of trying to appear stylish or elegant while dancing with a huge blob of plastic on your face is one of almost self-aware silliness, it does have one standout feature that took us off guard… Multiplayer. That’s right, certain rooms in the game allow for both competitive and cooperative gameplay as well as public chat areas, which takes away some of the anti-social nature of dancing alone in VR and is very welcomed addition to the game.\n\nRead the full review and more here: https://www.opiumpulses.com/article/306/10-oculus-quest-new-release-reviews-p1",
