							"reviewDescription": "This carnival-themed collection of six cute and cheerful minigames is both hit and miss, depending on the types of things you enjoy (we particularly enjoyed the firehose game). Very much aimed towards children, you unlock minigames one at a time until you’ve played each one at least once. With random chances to earn extra tokens with each play, which you can redeem and spend on a wheel of fortune, unlocking cosmetics and items you can use with each of the minigames.\n\nYou guide your character around a fairground, selecting each minigame and its difficulty variant by walking towards it. There’s maybe some fun to be had as an adult here, but it will be limited to an hour or so worth of play. Luckily the game is fairly priced, so you won’t feel short-changed. This started as an Oculus Go/Gear VR game, and while it plays perfectly well on the Quest, it doesn’t do much else to take advantage of the new 6DoF technology, just allows for more fluid and better-tracked movement. The golf game, however, seems overly wonky and not optimised fully to 6DoF controls. Would nice to see a few games made specifically with the Quest in mind.\n\nAreas for improvement would be firstly multiplayer, right now this is just pass-and-play, which can barely be considered multiplayer. Your character seems to have a stock look, you can’t customise the way they look outside of unlocked cosmetics, which was an odd choice considered there are so many other kids at the carnival they could have allowed you to pick from. It would have been nice to allow you to control your character with the thumbstick on the Quest controllers, as opposed to pointing and clicking where you want him/her to move, this was clearly left over from the Go version and seems an odd choice when playing on the Quest. Besides all that, it’s a nice collection of child-friendly minigames that should keep 'em entertained.\n\nRead the full review and more here: https://www.opiumpulses.com/article/411/10-more-oculus-quest-game-reviews-p2",
