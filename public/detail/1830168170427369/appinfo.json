							"reviewDescription": "I really enjoyed my time with Supernatural, I have a week or so left on my free trial.  The coaches are fantastic, music is good for the most part, some big misses there too unfortunately but I can understand the pain of the devs having to buy rights. In a 25 min workout I burned on avg the same amount of calories I burn from a 30 min treadmill run, a little less. So a good supplemental workout or for missed gym days.\n\nWhere this app really shines is with the, forgive the term, \"coach potatoes\" who aren't athletes and have trouble getting motivated to join a gym or to improve their fitness. They will see big changes because they are normally doing little to no daily activity. \n\nThe workouts are fun at first but lose their appeal quickly,  after the first few goes for me, but it's still easy to get into and can be done in your living room. Win. The free trial is a great way to try it out, kudos to the devs for this. I was disappointed my brand new Samsung Active 2 Watch had no compatibility and it seems devs only thought of Apple users here. The only other improvement point for me is I had 2 crashes where screen went black during a load to new song and never came back... this took me out of the mood to workout and re starting the game it had lost all the workout progress! Was quite disappointing but I have no doubts the devs are aware and likely working on a fix.\n\nSadly, the membership fee will cost Supernatural most of their fans and prospective buyers, myself included. I simply can't pay the monthly fee for a program I might use 1-2x a week (or not at all like this week). People who pay to go to a gym aren't going to shell out another monthly fee for this. Professionals like myself with very little downtime aren't going to pay a monthly fee to use it once and awhile. Finally, it's just not marketed to me, a single male. If I had a family of 4 using this absolutely the single membership fee would be worth it! How is it fair a single adult will pay the same as a family of 4?!\n\nAnyways, I understand the monthly fee model and what you're going for here; but a huge recommendation to the devs:  offer a 2nd payment option, a one time payment. Take away the coaches, and make it a weekly or even monthly new workout instead of daily. Those missing the features will go back to monthly payments! Those who only have time to use the app a few times a month won't miss a thing. It's a win win and you still get paid!  Goodluck in the future with your app!",

We hope you can see us as a comparable fitness service to a gym, or other at home fitness solutions, but more fun. :) Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have questions and feedback, and we hope you'll give trial another go.",
