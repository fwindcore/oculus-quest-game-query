							"reviewDescription": "I am a big fan of story-driven games with puzzle elements, and I had hoped this game would be a strong contender. Unfortunately, this game was only so-so for me. Main issues were bugs (clipping, crashing), lack of real decisionmaking, and length (very short). \n\nIt was so short in fact, I would have qualified for a return if I hadn’t crashed multiple times and had to replay several chapters from scratch. And given you can’t skip narration, if you get sent back to the beginning, you are sitting there waiting to hear the same narration all over again, go through the same wrote motions again, and generally waste time trying to get back to where you left off.\n\nMovement was fine except there were issues with clipping into objects if you moved too close, and when you tried to back up, you might end up across the room again. Sometimes just to open a drawer I would need to click five or six times, getting too close, too far, just past, in the table, oriented wrong, okay got it. \n\nAnother reviewer mentioned that some of the stops along the way seemed like fun opportunities to explore, but they ended up being little to nothing to do. That was so right. Without spoilers, I can say that your chances to explore are limited, frustratingly tantalizing showing places you can’t go into, and your task when there is a simple “take this object, put it down over there.” Rinse, repeat.\n\nThe story was fine, voice acting above average, the ending a little lackluster. Animation was good, not great. Concept held so much potential Not worth $20 IMO, I’d wait until there is a great sale or the price comes own. If this were closer to a $5-$10 game I might have rated it higher, but for $20, the value just isn’t there.",
