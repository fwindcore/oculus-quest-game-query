It is a puzzle game yes but far more than that it is a story. As a lover of story based games and games that leave me thinking about the events after the game is over I love this game. It is exactly what I look for in a narrative game. Excellent voice acting, engaging story, lots of interesting extra story bits to discover, and just an overall pleasant experience. \n\nA couple of the puzzles had me stumped for a bit but in the end this is one of my favorite narrative games I've played in a while and definitely my favorite narative Quest game.",
