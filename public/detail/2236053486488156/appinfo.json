This first patch contains some quality of life improvements, balancing, Phobia Mode, and fixes to various issues. Thank you for your support, and for playing SWARM!\n\nDon't forget to join our Discord to get the latest news and a chance to participate in future betas: https://discord.gg/kdfaVQD\n\nNote: üì¢ indicates a change inspired by community feedback!\n\nBalancing\n- üì¢ Patched Basilisk (2-5) exploit that made it possible to beat the boss in 5 seconds. Discovered by Sage, one of our longtime playtesters. In his honor there's a new \"Sage Speedrunner\" achievement for beating every boss in under 3 minutes! The 2-5 leaderboard has been reset, so have at it!\n- üì¢ Reduced difficulty of 5-2\n\nFeatures\n- üì¢ Added Phobia Mode - this new setting disables sharks in Zone 1 and cloud falling in Zone 3. Access via Settings > Gameplay\n- üì¢ Added \"Around Me\" filter to leaderboard. From now on you can use the \"Global\" filter to see the top of the leaderboard, and \"Around Me\" to see a leaderboard centered on your high score.\n- üì¢ In boss levels, show time passed and potential score on the drone scoreboard\n- Tweaked grapple aim so it feels more accurate. Aiming should also be easier when you're not looking at the target.\n\nGraphics\n- Reduce aliasing in Zone 4 EQ screens and various other places\n- Fix some rendering issues in codex unlocks\n\nBug Fixes\n- üì¢ Fix audio spike when loading or retrying a level\n- üì¢ Fix bug where missiles sometimes don't despawn at the end of a game\n- Fix various issues with boss death animation and sound\n- Fix bug where tutorial UI can appear incorrect after resetting progress\n- Fix bug where Scattershot boss (1-5) does two shield phases in a row\n- Minor bug fixes and tweaks to the final boss",

Swarm is a VR arcade shooter that gives players a grappling hook & gun in each hand, they're then thrown into a colourful, chaotic world filled with enemy robots that need annihilating, the only way to do this is to swing as fast and as high as possible whilst dodging their attacks and blowing them to pieces. It is CRAZY FUN! \n\nThe most surprising thing that I have to emphasise is the fact that I felt no motion sickness whilst playing, none what so ever. The development team have done an incredible job of making the game fast, fluid and action packed whilst simultaneously not making it vomit enducing. I'd be interested to hear other peoples experience but I for one was pleasantly surprised but just how good this feels to play even at the most hectic of moments.\n\nThose looking for a VR arcade shooter that they can sink hours into chasing high scores and completing all the optional objectives should definitely pay Swarm some attention, it feels poised to be extremely popular and more pick up and play experiences will always be welcome for the Oculus Quest / Oculus Quest 2. It's Spiderman, Jet Set Radio & Space Invaders all rolled into one insane package!",
