These anonymous stories are revealing and inspiring, encouraging reflection and introspection. To progress, you must leave your own stories behind for others to uncover\n\nVisually beautiful and wholly transformative, Where Thoughts Go thematically explores the course of a lifetime through five simple questions written to dig deep. The voice recordings you hear are unique and unidentifiable, left by individuals from every walk of life, every age and every background. Participants have no way to discern who they are hearing from, only how considerate and sensitive each and every person is. \n\nThis project is under development.

							"reviewDescription": "Quite possibly the most beautiful and heart-warming titles we have ever reviewed in VR. The basic concept is that you are asked questions about yourself and you must answer truthfully. All those that have spent time in Where Thoughts Go before you will have already recorded their responses and are there for you to listen to while you think of your own response. Some answers can be very generic while others can be a lot more emotional and from the heart. While some questions (such as childhood dreams) can be very straight cut, some questions go a lot deeper and you really get the impression that these thoughts might be the first time these people have uttered the words out loud.\n\nAs there is no identifying information or names etc shared with users, you really are sharing your thoughts, hopes and fears with complete strangers around the world, with the safety of knowing you don’t have to answer to or explain yourself to anyone. We wouldn’t be surprised if the nature in which you are able to safely express yourself and listen to what weighs on other possibly like-minded people, might have a deeply positive psychological effect on the people sharing their thoughts, without there ever being any actual intervention from family, professionals or other potentially judgmental influences. You’re completely free to send your feelings out into the void.\n\nWe didn’t hear any trolling or childish responses to the questions meaning they’re possibly vetted before being submitted, which can be seen as either a good or bad thing (who’s to say whose thoughts are worthy of being shared for example). Also, it seems like you basically have to contribute before you can move on to listen to more question responses, which does give people the nudge they might need to get their voice out there, but it also seems a little pushy for people who are genuinely terrified of speaking up. Overall a great social experiment.\n\nRead the full review and more here: https://www.opiumpulses.com/article/417/",
