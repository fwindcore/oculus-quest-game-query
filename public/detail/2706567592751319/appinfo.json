So here are a few things to make intentionally touching what you should not even better:\n\n- Buttons and wheels respond more naturally and follow the laws of physics. You definitely should not be touching them, but if you’re feeling rebellious they should now be easier to use.\n\n- Books and other held objects are oriented correctly when held or opened. Should you choose to hold them or open them... which you were politely asked not to.\n\n- Binders should not be touched. But if you pick one up, no other binders will launch discontentedly for not being The Chosen One.\n\n- The stamp now shows a green return position outline... should you want to make it seem like you in fact, did not touch it.\n\n- In an attempt to rid the room of haunted spirits, audio is now spatialized around the correct position (your head).\n\n- The credits have been updated because inclusion is nice 😀",

							"reviewDescription": "From the moment you are told to leave things well alone , you know things are about to go horribly wrong. The developer here has done a great job of just dropping you in a situation, whilst letting your natural curiosity flourish. Please be aware that this game is both incredibly repetitive and very difficult. There are loads of endings that are bought on by doing several things in a certain order. Many of these tasks are seemingly impossible and it is only with trial and error that you will unearth the secrets. When I say trial I mean TRIAL. You will need to click every centimeter of this room and look at pretty much every object. Even the most hardened investigator will struggle here. But with patience comes reward. Unlocking any if the so-called endings results in a mini event that can both demonstrate the effects of VR and others completely weird you out. \n\nThe gameplay mechanics for the most part work but there are several annoying bits that will challenge your patience. Be prepared for objects to vanish, clash with one another and even float out of the hand. Yes many objects have a mind of their own - especially the Phone! (Phone???)  Also do not drop objects on the floor as they are incredibly difficult to pick up again. \nIf you are an inquisitive person that doesn't mind repetition and seek to overcome any challenges in your way, then this may be the game for you. If you are a completionist much can be said for the same feeling of success. Every ending event bringing a sigh of relief, followed by omg why didn't I think of that before! \n\nSo all in all this can be a great VR experience and dare I say, even show your friends a different look at VR. It is incredibly challenging and unless you are an absolute genius will not get more than 12 endings (of which there are a ton more than this) without any assistance of having to look for hints online. \n\nTo add to the minor list of annoying things. The use of tiny buttons behind and next to eachother can having you pulling your hair out as you accidentally swipe across the wrong one. Hmmm what was that button sequence again? Grrr",
