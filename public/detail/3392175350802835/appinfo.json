							"reviewDescription": "Hand tracking has limitations on the quest so this game can‚Äôt really reach its full potential. So that part isn‚Äôt the games fault. If we ignore this I would‚Äôve easily given it a 5 stars if it was  free as I don‚Äôt think the price justifies for the content. You‚Äôll play this game for 10 minutes and then never touch it again. It‚Äôs just a cool presentation of what hand tracking can do but it‚Äôs no more than that. It‚Äôs a tech demo not a game, and I personally don‚Äôt think the price is right.\n\nHowever, the puzzles in the game are really fun and if you really think you‚Äôll enjoy this game you might get a couple of hours of content out if here. \n\nGrind: If you want to unlock game modes for the sandbox mode you can play trough the puzzles and unlock stars which will then unlock new gamemodes in the sandbox mode\nReplayability: not really any replay value unless you want to collect all the stars and really like the puzzles\n\nThe game itself is good, but there isn‚Äôt much to keep you coming back for more which is understandable as this isn‚Äôt really a game and more of an experience. I would prefer if the game was free (I really want to support the devs but this is more of a showcase on what VR can do than something I‚Äôd pay for so idk.)\nI do recommend it especially if you‚Äôre interested in hand tasking. But the hand tracking isn‚Äôt the best and this isn‚Äôt the devs fault but the Hardware. \n\nI‚Äôll give it a 7/10",
