							"body_text": "Our first-ever cinematic campaign featuring five linked scenes is out now!\n\nAbout 2089\nThe robot-plagued future is here, and it needs the perfect hero. It needs you. 2089, our first-ever cinematic campaign featuring a gritty sci-fi story and five linked scenes is our biggest update yet! Become John Asimov, as you use new weapons to survive an off-world plague of killer machines and unravel the mystery behind their violent uprising, all set to a sweet synth-wave inspired soundtrack.\n\nThis update also sees a complete overhaul of the user interface, LIV integration upgrades, some improvements to enemy behaviors, as well as reactivation of the “You’re Breathtaking” achievement.\n\nA new story-rich cinematic experience\nFeaturing tracks from Black Tiger Sex Machine, Draeden, Processor, and an exclusive remix from the legendary Magic Sword, the five linked scenes--played in order--make up the most we’ve dropped simultaneously, ever.\n\nThe campaign is illustrated through immersive cinematics by Comic Artist and Creator Fico Ossio, who has helped to bring life to some of our favourite heroes, including G.I.JOE, Transformers, TMNT, and Spider-Man. The campaign, inspired by some of our favourite 80’s science fiction films, also includes new enemies, weapons, models, mechanics, and more.\n\nWith this update, we hope to continually reinvent the classic action-rhythm FPS playstyle Pistol Whip is known for by continuing to expand our catalog of genres, not just musically, but cinematically, mechanically, narratively, heroically (what types of heroes you embody), and visually.\n\nIf you’re a veteran or have experience playing Pistol Whip, you can expect the difficulty of 2089 to be the toughest you’ve faced yet. Don’t worry, though; it’s nothing a trained hero like you can’t handle.\n\n2089 will be our final update of 2020 and is our gift to all Pistol Whip owners this holiday season, coming less than a month after Pistol Whip’s first anniversary. From Immersive Reality Game of the Year at the 2019 D.I.C.E. Awards to former Myth-busting hero Adam Savage creating an awesome custom Pistol Whip controller, the last year has been truly exhilarating. We can’t wait to show you what else we have in store for the future of Pistol Whip with our next massive, game-changing update, Concierge, due Spring 2021.\n\nLove,\n\nCloudhead Games\n\nPistol Whip \"2089\" Update Changelog\n- Added “2089” Cinematic Action-Campaign:\n- \"Scene 1: Revolt” (3 difficulties)\n- \"Scene 2: Cage Fight\" (3 difficulties)\n- \"Scene 3: Metal Mincer\" Scene (3 difficulties)\n- \"Scene 4: The Nest\" Scene (3 difficulties)\n- \"Scene 5: Die by Dawn\" Scene (3 difficulties)\n- 6 Cinematics: Revolt Intro, Cage Fight Intro, Metal Mincer Intro, The Nest Intro, Die by Dawn Intro, 2089 Finale\n- New enemy faction: The Metal - 1 Shot Android, 2 Shot Android, 4 Shot Android\n- 3 New Enemy Types: Auto Turret (1 Shot), Minigun Turret (16 Shot), Shield Trooper (melee-only)\n- A MOTHER TRUCKIN’ BOSS\n- 1 New Weapon Type: Smart-burst Pistol\n\n- Completely redesigned User Interface: Added Arcade, Campaign, Challenge, Training, & Info sections\n- Added 4 new weapon models: The Sci-Fi Collection\n- Added 3 new sci-fi inspired weapon wraps\n- Added 9 new futuristic, and 9 new tactical colour customization options\n- Added 9 new space-infused metal finishes\n- Added 1 new weapon SFX: Number 6 - Sci-Fi Revolver\n- Implemented LIV 1.5 SDK integration\n- Fixed the “You’re Breathtaking” achievement (!)\n- Modifiers are no longer enabled in the tutorial\n- Fixed an issue causing weapon metals to display incorrectly when launching the game\n- Enemies were taught some rules of engagement and are less likely to shoot you in the back now",

I Boot up Pistol Whip for the very first time ever.\n\nNeon. A flickering NEON CITY. And a smooth gradual forward motion. I'm holding a simple gun. I have a feeling this is going to be my best friend... and then Zrrrrrrrp Boom Boom Boom. The thumping of electronic music fills the world. Immediately I start moving to the rhythm while absorbing the beautiful surroundings then suddenly out comes an enemy. \n\n\"Let's do this friendo\" I say to my semi automatic pistol gripped tightly in my hand. \n\nBANG BANG!\n\nThe bullets explode from the barrel to the beat of the thumping music. The enemy shatters into non existence!\n\nOut come a couple more.\n\nBANG BANG BANG!\n\nAgain, firing to the thumping beat.\n\nA smile stretches from ear to ear. I release my whole body to the rhythm of the world.\n\nDodging pillars. Uppercutting enemies. Ducking. Spinning. This is all so natural. AND AMAZING.\n\nAnd then a voice rips me from this fantasy followed by an arm poke.\n\nMy wife woke up and wondered what the heck is going on. I rip the headset off, breathing heavily and the only thing that feels appropriate to say is....\n\n\"WOAH!\"",
