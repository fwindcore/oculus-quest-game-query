							"body_text": "Our first-ever cinematic campaign featuring five linked scenes is out now!\n\nAbout 2089\nThe robot-plagued future is here, and it needs the perfect hero. It needs you. 2089, our first-ever cinematic campaign featuring a gritty sci-fi story and five linked scenes is our biggest update yet! Become John Asimov, as you use new weapons to survive an off-world plague of killer machines and unravel the mystery behind their violent uprising, all set to a sweet synth-wave inspired soundtrack.\n\nThis update also sees a complete overhaul of the user interface, LIV integration upgrades, some improvements to enemy behaviors, as well as reactivation of the “You’re Breathtaking” achievement.\n\nA new story-rich cinematic experience\nFeaturing tracks from Black Tiger Sex Machine, Draeden, Processor, and an exclusive remix from the legendary Magic Sword, the five linked scenes--played in order--make up the most we’ve dropped simultaneously, ever.\n\nThe campaign is illustrated through immersive cinematics by Comic Artist and Creator Fico Ossio, who has helped to bring life to some of our favourite heroes, including G.I.JOE, Transformers, TMNT, and Spider-Man. The campaign, inspired by some of our favourite 80’s science fiction films, also includes new enemies, weapons, models, mechanics, and more.\n\nWith this update, we hope to continually reinvent the classic action-rhythm FPS playstyle Pistol Whip is known for by continuing to expand our catalog of genres, not just musically, but cinematically, mechanically, narratively, heroically (what types of heroes you embody), and visually.\n\nIf you’re a veteran or have experience playing Pistol Whip, you can expect the difficulty of 2089 to be the toughest you’ve faced yet. Don’t worry, though; it’s nothing a trained hero like you can’t handle.\n\n2089 will be our final update of 2020 and is our gift to all Pistol Whip owners this holiday season, coming less than a month after Pistol Whip’s first anniversary. From Immersive Reality Game of the Year at the 2019 D.I.C.E. Awards to former Myth-busting hero Adam Savage creating an awesome custom Pistol Whip controller, the last year has been truly exhilarating. We can’t wait to show you what else we have in store for the future of Pistol Whip with our next massive, game-changing update, Concierge, due Spring 2021.\n\nLove,\n\nCloudhead Games\n\nPistol Whip \"2089\" Update Changelog\n- Added “2089” Cinematic Action-Campaign:\n- \"Scene 1: Revolt” (3 difficulties)\n- \"Scene 2: Cage Fight\" (3 difficulties)\n- \"Scene 3: Metal Mincer\" Scene (3 difficulties)\n- \"Scene 4: The Nest\" Scene (3 difficulties)\n- \"Scene 5: Die by Dawn\" Scene (3 difficulties)\n- 6 Cinematics: Revolt Intro, Cage Fight Intro, Metal Mincer Intro, The Nest Intro, Die by Dawn Intro, 2089 Finale\n- New enemy faction: The Metal - 1 Shot Android, 2 Shot Android, 4 Shot Android\n- 3 New Enemy Types: Auto Turret (1 Shot), Minigun Turret (16 Shot), Shield Trooper (melee-only)\n- A MOTHER TRUCKIN’ BOSS\n- 1 New Weapon Type: Smart-burst Pistol\n\n- Completely redesigned User Interface: Added Arcade, Campaign, Challenge, Training, & Info sections\n- Added 4 new weapon models: The Sci-Fi Collection\n- Added 3 new sci-fi inspired weapon wraps\n- Added 9 new futuristic, and 9 new tactical colour customization options\n- Added 9 new space-infused metal finishes\n- Added 1 new weapon SFX: Number 6 - Sci-Fi Revolver\n- Implemented LIV 1.5 SDK integration\n- Fixed the “You’re Breathtaking” achievement (!)\n- Modifiers are no longer enabled in the tutorial\n- Fixed an issue causing weapon metals to display incorrectly when launching the game\n- Enemies were taught some rules of engagement and are less likely to shoot you in the back now",

							"reviewDescription": "Okay so i know this will sound cliche BUT, I have to say it.\n\nI play a lot of games and  this is the first time i've ever left a  review for a game. I play mobile/console/pc/etc name it, im on it -pause-\n\nThis is easily one of the best games on quest 2, PERIOD. \n\nOn the oculus ive played most of the popular games from Beat Saber to Population One, The Walking Dead , Moss  etc and I have more fun on pistol whip then any of them. \n\nNot taking anything away from the games i mentioned above . They are fantastic games themselves but they come second to pistol whip for me \n\nYes Im that impressed with pistol whip. \n\nEverytime I play this game 4 things happen. I loose track of time / I have fun / I break things and i lose 5 pounds 🙃 no cap (FYI, I am very athletic, so trust me when I say u get a work out. Especially on hard mode)\n\nI have nothing bad to say about this game , the  tracking is on point; very accurate. \n\nOnly suggestion i would make is :\n\n1) Introduce some sort of multiplayer. IDK how yall gonna do it 😅 but I wanna see it\n\n[Yes you can try and beat real players and friends scores on the board  but i'd like a real multiplayer too like a co-op or Some sort of PVP]\n\n2) Have more genre of songs. The ones on there are great. I listen to every genre so i have no problem with them and they get me hype.  But I'd like a little more of variety of genres like beat saber has. \n\nBeat saber has  all of these I mentioned and it makes the game feel endless in a good way.  Yet I still like pistol whip more\n\nAgain superb game.\n\nIf you want to have fun. Lose track of time and \nlose a few pounds just buy it already you wont regret it\n\nFYI: I am a real person 🤣 no one payed me or gave me a discount  for this game . I just liked the game a lot and want more people to play it  for when the time come and they introduce real multipayer 😈",
