We’re also introducing rhythm-based climbing where you’ll see disappearing grips along your route, requiring you to learn the grip patterns to the beat of a background track to progress through. You will unlock each of the 6 levels step by step, and once all are completed you will receive a new glove as a completion reward.\n\nLast but not least this update includes general bug fixes as well. We will be monitoring closely what is said, and we will make it to a point to address issues you might encounter as soon as possible.\n\nMajor known issues of this update:\n#1 Game might shut down and restart when returning from Oculus menu (this is a OS related issue!)\n#2 UI breaks when starting a Ghost Race without having a connection to server\n\nWe hope you now have a smoother climbing experience.\n\nStay healthy, and have fun scaling new heights!",

							"reviewDescription": "New to the climb and bought the duo pack. Only tried the climb 2 so far and it’s great! However as others have said there are some technical issues, and I can’t help feeling the devs could have added more innovative features to give this more replay value. \n\nTech wise, I’ve now also noticed the foveated rendering, which is a shame. Because a cool part of the game is to look around and appreciate surroundings, and it’s rather obvious that parts of the frame are lower Res, particularly when glancing down - which is surely a key thing in climbing. Also I keep getting the pop up to recentre my camera, happens a lot. It’s crashed a few times as others have stated. And once you start looking you do realise the backgrounds are very static and it breaks the immersion.\n\nIn terms of ideas, how about:\n\n- a photography mode where you have to take pictures of certain scenes or the wildlife \n- a nature mode where you have to actually rescue or recover the wildlife \n- some kind of lost object mode (like lost balls in walkabout golf) to make you want to explore all nooks and crannies \n- add hydration as a parameter you must manage - take drinks from your backpack or you faint on more demanding levels and vision goes grey \n- zen mode with ability to play your own music whilst climbing \n-ice climbing with a pick axe!\n- ability to bring up a map to show you where you are on the mountain \n- better race mechanics with friends - verbal update how far behind or ahead you are at every save point. Just not very exciting if you can’t actually see their hands once ahead or behind. \n- ability to Base jump or take a hang glider off the top of the mountain and fly around or return to the bottom - that would be awesome!\n- create a ‘base camp’ area at the start of the game where you can also interact with friends over a beer. Ability to race in real time. \n- add more locations as DLC!\n\nSo you see, so much potential to make this truly amazing if the devs are reading this!!",
