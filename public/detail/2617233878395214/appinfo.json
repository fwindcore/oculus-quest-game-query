Disclaimer: We are currently investigating on the stalls that might still potentially cause after returning to the menu or opening the leaderboard. We'll have a fix for you soon.\n \n\n- We've removed the option to disable body orientation as this feature has caused some players to not be able to pull themselves up at checkpoints. We will re-introduce this option at a later date again.\n\n \n- The issue with the placeholder strings has now been resolved.\nDisclaimer: If you still see placeholder strings when you launch the game please select any of the supported languages in-game and this will resolve the issue!\n\n \nLast but not least we are aware that some of you experience flickering and a few occasional crashes. We are monitoring closely what is said, and we will make it to a point to include those fixes with upcoming updates.\n\n \nWe hope you now have a smoother climbing experience!\n \nStay healthy, and have fun scaling new heights!",

							"reviewDescription": "New to the climb and bought the duo pack. Only tried the climb 2 so far and it’s great! However as others have said there are some technical issues, and I can’t help feeling the devs could have added more innovative features to give this more replay value. \n\nTech wise, I’ve now also noticed the foveated rendering, which is a shame. Because a cool part of the game is to look around and appreciate surroundings, and it’s rather obvious that parts of the frame are lower Res, particularly when glancing down - which is surely a key thing in climbing. Also I keep getting the pop up to recentre my camera, happens a lot. It’s crashed a few times as others have stated. And once you start looking you do realise the backgrounds are very static and it breaks the immersion.\n\nIn terms of ideas, how about:\n\n- a photography mode where you have to take pictures of certain scenes or the wildlife \n- a nature mode where you have to actually rescue or recover the wildlife \n- some kind of lost object mode (like lost balls in walkabout golf) to make you want to explore all nooks and crannies \n- add hydration as a parameter you must manage - take drinks from your backpack or you faint on more demanding levels and vision goes grey \n- zen mode with ability to play your own music whilst climbing \n-ice climbing with a pick axe!\n- ability to bring up a map to show you where you are on the mountain \n- better race mechanics with friends - verbal update how far behind or ahead you are at every save point. Just not very exciting if you can’t actually see their hands once ahead or behind. \n- ability to Base jump or take a hang glider off the top of the mountain and fly around or return to the bottom - that would be awesome!\n- create a ‘base camp’ area at the start of the game where you can also interact with friends over a beer. Ability to race in real time. \n- add more locations as DLC!\n\nSo you see, so much potential to make this truly amazing if the devs are reading this!!",
