							"body_text": "Whether you want to sit behind the wheel for some intense driving action or take in the spectacle from above, the tiny cars of Mini Motor Racing X pack a sizable fun-filled punch with four all-new party games that take the multiplayer mayhem to a new level.\n\nIn Bombs Away, all players start in the center of the arena. A random player starts with the bomb, which brings with it enhanced speed. The player with the bomb can ram another player to pass the bomb onto them. Whoever has the bomb when the fuse runs down (and explodes) loses one health pip, and they start with a fresh bomb. Last one standing wins.\n\n\n\nIn King of the Road, all players once again start in the center of the arena, with a random player donning the crown—which earns you points while wearing it. Players must try to ram the crown holder to get the crown for themselves. Whoever has the most points when the time limit runs out wins.\n\n\n\nEach player in Battle Arena starts with three health pips, and cars start spread out across the arena. Players pick up random weapons or items and attempt to attack the other players while avoiding their attacks. Last one standing wins.\n\n\n\nDrop Zone mixes things up, with players starting spaced out around a floating platform. Players aim to knock each other off the edge of the platform—which shrinks over time, increasing the danger. Last one standing wins.\n\n\n\nReady to put the pedal to the metal and see how your racing skills stack up against the competition? Check out Mini Motor Racing X and the free Party Pack Update available now!",

							"reviewDescription": "I'm not going to say this game fundamentally changes gaming. In any other scenerio it would be a cheao game you'd play for an hour and get bored of, but once you throw it into a VR setting things change. \n\nIf you're a fan of RC Pro Am or Super Offroad then you'll fall in love immediately, because it's basically that. But then they also have some Mario kart stuff in another game mode. And a game mode similar to Rocket League. And a few dozen vehicles and tracks. And there's multiple camera angles including POV cockpit view that makes it feel like a different game. So there's a fair amount of content here.\n\nThe reason this works for VR is because it really does build upon the remote control car experience and doesn't require a huge amount of space to experience. It's RC car racing with fantastic environments, the physics are fun and arcade, and the price is pretty good for the amount of content. It's exceptionally good at what it sets out to do, and VR adds a lot to the experience.",
