							"reviewDescription": "Virtual Reality is the perfect medium for those wanting to explore natural wonders around the world and National Geographic have attempted to do just that. You’ll visit two locations in Peru and Antarctica, experiencing landmarks and wildlife in both while narration and voice acted characters in the game talk you through the history and facts about each location. You’ll have tasks to take photos in-game of particular scenes, objects or animals that will unlock more information about that specific area. The graphics aren’t anything to get excited by but they serve the purpose and look good enough to closely resemble their real-world counterparts.\n\nEach area will likely take the average person around an hour to complete in full, but there is enough content to keep each hour engaging and interesting, for example, the Antarctica area has proper kayaking and mountain climbing sections, the latter of which was genuinely immersive and fun. The camera element seems a little gimmicky but you can place photos in frames in your in-game home and can even share them on Facebook so they have at least fleshed those features out somewhat. You can take each experience at your own pace and can choose between teleporting and locomotion controls which is a nice addition, although sadly no properly implemented seated mode, which seems unfortunate for a game that could specifically help disabled people explore the world.\n\nThere are sadly a few big things we don’t enjoy about NGE, firstly it just doesn’t seem to have much polish; getting too close to walls just turns the whole screen black, objects falling through the floor and ice picks would regularly clip through the mountain or get stuck entirely. There’s also no way to go back over the content you've already experienced without listening to all the instructions and dialogue again. The narration can also come across as patronising and over-enthusiastic at times.\n\nRead the full review and more: https://www.opiumpulses.com/article/424/",
