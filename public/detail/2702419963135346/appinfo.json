In Color Space you don’t just color in a scene — you color inside a scene.\nEquipped with a palette and a coloring wand, you’re transported into any of 20 beautiful black-and-white worlds. You fill in the world with as many colors as you like, one tree, rock and flower at a time.\nAs you color, the scene comes to life around you. Rivers run, birds fly, planets revolve, meteors shine. The soundscape responds hypnotically as you color.",

							"reviewDescription": "Essentially a three-dimensional colouring book, we recently reviewed another artistic Oculus Quest title called ScuptVR and our main issue with that is that if you aren’t all that creative then it can be hard to know where to start or what to build (which also made the game hard to review!). Color Space doesn’t have this problem, the environments are created for you and are on the pages of various books which signify different themes of the spaces available to paint (wildlife, transport etc). You have incredibly easy to use tools to colour every unique object and area of terrain in the world around you, complete freedom allows you to colour familiar words in bizarre colours, no strings attached.\n\nYour paint palette and wand have visual tools that are mapped to the location of buttons on your controllers, which means making changes and colour tweaks is refreshingly simple. We can imagine this would be wonderfully relaxing and enjoyable for people of all ages, from children to the elderly. One nice touch is that scenes almost come to life as you colour areas around you, almost like you’re bringing the drawings to life. The team still seem to be added more content for free so hopefully, they continue to add extra scenes, or maybe even allow user-submitted content somehow?\n\nSome things we’d love to see to help the game improve would be the ability to colour the sky-box, a way to play the game online with others would be great and help give the game replayability after players start to run out of scenes to colour in and a way for more content to trickle into the game to keep things fresh, maybe there’s opportunity to work out some licensing deals. Overall Color Space is a really nice way to just sit back and de-stress in VR and relax your mind but our main concern is longevity. Color Space only smudges a few lines and rates a 4/5.\n\nRead the full review and more here: https://www.opiumpulses.com/article/417/10-more-oculus-quest-game-reviews-p3",
