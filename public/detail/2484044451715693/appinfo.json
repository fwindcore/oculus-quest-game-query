							"body_text": "CARDIO LEVELS now available on all 18 songs\n\nIntroducing our new Cardio Levels! Based on the amazing feedback from our beta tester community, we're happy to announce that our experimental Cardio levels were such a hit, that we've now created one for every song in the game! Thank you to all of our fitness-focused Trippers for giving us such great feedback to help make this possible.\n\nSo, WHAT IS A CARDIO LEVEL?? These levels are a bit different than the others... They focus on giving you a Cardio(vascular) workout -- They include BIG, full-range, repetitious movements to get your heart pumping! So now you can workout to a star-studded tracklist including artists such as Lady Gaga, Skrillex, Zedd, and more! And of course, you can follow our lead on these new choreographies and copy these moves into your own songs with our in-VR editor to create your own workouts.\n\nBut first, a few words of CAUTION for these new levels...\n- Make sure you warm up first, as these levels require full-range full body movement. Remember to squat and lean with your knees, and move your feet if you need to reach!\n- These moves require a bigger playspace than our other levels, so check your surroundings and proceed with caution.\n- These levels are not recommended for Beginners - They are designed to be around a Regular level difficulty.\n\nAlso... some Cardio levels are inherently more strenuous than others. \nHere's a tip: Dance Monkey and Golden Pineapple are easier Cardio levels, and Jurassic Snack Pack and Red are... let's just say you'll need endurance.\n\nSo... Got some dusty fitness-related New Year resolutions on the shelf? It's time to smash through them.\n\nHave fun, stay hydrated, and keep dancing,\n♥️ Kinemotik",
