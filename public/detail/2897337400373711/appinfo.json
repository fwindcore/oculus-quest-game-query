What kind of survivor will you be for the people of NOLA? \n \nScavenge for anything that you can weapons, food, tools, and clues.\n \nBe wary of the living and the dead: spatial audio will draw attention to any loud noise, bullets or otherwise.\n \nCraft makeshift gear out of scrapped material blades, guns, medicine, and more.\n \nSurvive your way: Use stealth or fight head on. Scavenge or complete jobs for others.\n \nTest your morals: make difficult choices for yourself and others.",

							"reviewDescription": "Per my own experience, I usually don't click to crouch and crouch on my own for better immersion, you'll understand why that's a note in a moment.\nWhen I first started this game I had not a clue how it would differ from watching the first mission played, boy was I in for a treat. For one, I really tried my best to avoid being seen but sometimes you just don't have enough time. But this game really helps you hone your feelings throughout the apocalypse, I'm barely on the second map and I'm starting to improve. But boy, when the bells are about to go off, you're a fool if you don't tuck tail and dip, I've gotta be one lucky SOB for when I underestimated the bells; in the middle of a house and realized I didn't complete my objective and spent too much time sneaking in human territory collecting supplies. The music reached a pretty high peak and continued to revamp to help emphasize the absolute hell I was about to experience. Decided its best not trying to juggle a few more walkers than I already had to, so that I would start heading out and I took the front door -first mistake- and was quickly hit with the realization I may not be able to outrun them if they spot me. Too late... I tucked to my right to head around back in hope to lose them- second mistake- and was quickly aroused by the greeting of two more walkers in the way. Quickly jabbing the nearest one, I realized, every single second counts, and I can't afford to leave my weapon encapsulated in this skull, but the herd behind me caught up, and yanking the bloody thing took all my energy; and one of them is within grabbing distance and I'm the Prey. Whipping him off and turning back down the alley, it literally hit me, I forgot about the second b****rd. Now it's hit me, I'm out of energy, I won't recover in time, my weapon is about to break, and I'm carrying the world's anxiety on my shoulders. I don't know how, and I don't remember the next few seconds, but miraculously, I'm nearing a wall and I'm being cornered. But huzzah! A hole in the wall! Maybe there is hope for me yet! Tucking tail real hard this time, I got on the floor and literally crawled through the space watching them close in on my being, reaching out to me as I try to shuffle on my back out of there, staring into those pursuiting, lifeless eyes. Thank God, I got through and I can take a breath, but I have to be very fortunate to sneak by and get to my skiff without alerting any more, and boy did my luck run out to get to that very moment, and sneak through with the last thing chasing me to my skiff being an ocean of Anxiety, but got away with a sense of accomplishment to survive what I thought was the end. If you've read all this, kudos to you. This game was worth it, no regret and so excited to survive more",
