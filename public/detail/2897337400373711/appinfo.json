Travel through the ruins of walker infested New Orleans as you fight, sneak, scavenge, and survive each day unraveling a city wide mystery within the iconic quarters. Encounter desperate factions and lone survivors who could be friend or foe. Whether you help others or take what you want by force, every choice you make has consequences. What kind of survivor will you be for the people of NOLA? \n \nScavenge for anything that you can weapons, food, tools, and clues.\n \nBe wary of the living and the dead: spatial audio will draw attention to any loud noise, bullets or otherwise.\n \nCraft makeshift gear out of scrapped material blades, guns, medicine, and more.\n \nSurvive your way: Use stealth or fight head on. Scavenge or complete jobs for others.\n \nTest your morals: make difficult choices for yourself and others.",

							"reviewDescription": "Hey you, yes you, are you a little turd who gets insulted by a video game NPC and walks away? Or are you a chad that insults rude NPCs with the power of sharp objects/firearms? Well you can do both in Walking Dead: Saints and Sinners. This game is easily the best VR game you’re getting on the quest store, and now that trial mode is around, it’s only getting better. Allow me to list some of the things I adore about this game, and then some of the things I have some gripes about.\n\nPros:\n-Do whatever the hell you want.\nDoes that lady from the main storyline annoy you? You can solve that problem and turn your tourist lifestyle into a problem solving lifestyle. Seriously, you can pretty much cap just about anyone, and the only railroaded part of the plot is the radio guy (I’m gonna stay vague to avoid spoilers) you can stealth around and spare as many as possible, or do the exact opposite and craft nail bombs and go to town\n\n-Looting/crafting system\nWhile durability on weapons in video games usually grinds my gears and makes my monky brain angry, S&S gets a pass, because the looting system is cool, at least for me, running around knifing zombos and permanently borrowing supplies from random houses is enjoyable, and the durability is very manageable, if you’re worried about your pistol breaking, bring another one\n\n-two handed guns (rifles, shotguns, the works)\nShotguns are a joy to use because, well, uhhhhh boom stick make problem go bye bye.\nAnd rifles hold a special place in my heart because hitting a glorious rifle shot is comparable to plugging your charger into the wall on the first try, or parallel parking perfectly, what I’m trying to say is, don’t use rifles in November because hitting those shots is nutworthy\n\n-Saints & Sinners\nAs you probably guessed, you can be a saint who helps people and does the right thing at any cost like a cliche cartoon hero, or abandon all morals, kill everyone for your own gain, become the cliche cartoon supervillain and secure the best loot\nWhile I attempt to make jokes, the game does a very good job of humanizing the NPCs and honestly I played a saint run for my first play through because I was too much of a coward to be a merciless machine\n\n-rifle satisfying\n\n\n“it’s a miracle of programming that they were able to get this on quest” - Sun Tzu\n\n-ambience\nMan. I hate rampart, that place has the spooky hallways and the incredible ambience and it makes me scared\n\n-sword\n\n-secret weapons\nWho doesn’t like a good secret saw blade axe, it’s something extra to do, and it looks cool as hell, plus there are lots of em\n\nCons:\n\n-pistol aiming\nIt’s all wonky, but you get used to it\n\n-difficultly\n2 separate playthroughs, no deaths, that being said I haven’t tried it on the hardest difficulty so this isn’t a strong point against the game\n\n-spook\nIt scary game, it make scare, scare\n\n-flashlight is the antagonist \nThis game is dark, that’s fine, it’s way more immersive and spooky that way, BUT there is a limit when my flashlight keeps DYING IN RAMPART HIGH AND I HEAR THE ZOMBOS BUT I CANT SEE THEM BECAUSE I NEED TO JERK MY FLASHLIGHT OFF UNTIL IT DECIDES TO BUST A LIGHT\n\n-can’t put cowboy hat on\n\n-THE BIGGEST CON IN THE GAME\nYou can’t do a one hand spin with the lever-action and I like the lever action but I can’t dual wield them and spin those mfers around like a cowboy on meth :(\n\n\nOverall this game is sick, no viruses, and I could continue to suck it off for a few hours but instead I’ll give you a some lifesaving tips for new players\n\nDon’t worry about the day system, it’s harmless\n\nTry to build a supply of medicine, and be careful around stuff that lowers max health\n\nDon’t eat junk food unless it’s a last resort\n\nBuild a supply of homemade food, that way you won’t lower max health\n\nKeep a bunch of bandages\n\nAlways stay strapped\n\n\nTL;DR\nGame good, do what you want, spooky, flashlight is Billie eyelash because it’s the bad guy, please let me one hand reload the lever-action please please please\n\nYeah I forgot about the bow but that’s because archery is for nerds when you have gun",
