Please read the following:\n\nControls:\n\n- Smooth Turning Added - We have added a smooth turning mode for those who prefer this style. This is available via the comfort section of the settings menu.\n\nGameplay:\n\n- Grenade Launcher - The grenade launcher projectiles now explode on contact with enemies rather than bouncing.\n\n- Chapter 9 Boss Storm Bolters - Two of the Storm Bolters had inconsistent behaviours, this has been rectified to make this encounter more enjoyable.\n\n- Power Sword - The Power Sword itself now glows with dangerous power\n\n- Chapter 10 Enemies - The visuals of the enemies in Chapter 10 have been improved along with tweaks to their AI to increase their intelligence.\n\n- Chapter 7 Boss - logic, visual effect and animation improvements to this boss encounter to make it more lethal and challenging.\n\n- Chapter 2 Window - a shiny new window looking out to Belis Retani beyond.\n\n- Chapter 6 Puzzle Refinement - improvements to the puzzles in Chapter 6 that help to signpost gameplay and readability.\n\n- Score Tracking and Balancing - Inconsistencies between score tracking in campaign mode and level replay have been removed. As a consequence of this, we need to reset leaderboards to ensure a level playing field for those chasing top scores, we apologise for the inconvenience of this.\n\nBug Fixes:\n\n- Environment Streaming Tweaks - to remove some environment pop in occurring.\n\n- General Stability Improvements - a series of bug fixes and improvements to increase overall game stability. This includes visual fixes, nav mesh fixes for stuck enemies and minor bugs found by the community.\n\nWe will continue to refine and update the experience of Battle Sister based on community feedback and reports in future updates. We would like to say a huge thank you to everyone who has shared their feedback with us so far.\n\nHappy Holidays from the Pixel Toys team!",

							"reviewDescription": "Updated: After playing more rating went up\nPros:\n-*Sometimes* environments look legitimately impressive and I forget this is mobile VR. I'm not very far and have said \"Oh wow\" more than once.\n-Hands don't clip through world geometry - THANK YOU!\n-Options for simple or manual reload - Nice! This is the perfect compromise, when I'm dual wielding I can still reload, otherwise I can physically insert and remove magazines with my off hand. That's how it's done!\n-Weapon and Character models look VERY nice!\n-Voice acting/music are top notch!\n-Some pretty cool action set pieces given the hardware\n-I wasn't interested in Warhammer before trying this, I sure am now!\n-I initially wrote combat wasn't all that engaging. I was wrong, it starts to get real good in the second level when you're swapping between pistols and machine guns and the challenge has been ramping up. I've been forcing my self to manually reload and that does a LOT to make combat more interesting, a kind of built in difficulty level and it feels so dang good.\n-Sound effects are great w/ headphones (Quest 2 speakers don't do them justice)\n\nCons:\n-Biggest problem is the range of quality in materials, which span from N64 rocks to current gen top tier mobile shaders in the same view. You can tell there's beautiful work under all that blur tho.\n-The first level didn't leave the best impression \n-Physics can feel a little jank at times, but I'd rather that than no physics, worth it and obvious hardware constraint.\n\nIf you're a huge Warhammer fan or you are on the Quest 1 it's a no brainer, the gameplay is totally there. No regrets purchasing, can't wait to see this w/ Quest 2 updates and the PCVR version soon? I think? If a PCVR version is coming, wow can't wait! That would fix my only complaints probably!!! If this is cross buy, it's one heck of a bargain, if not it's a bit steep pre-multiplayer.",

Rift version will be releasing later this year, as well as a horde mode, multiplayer, and lots more additional content!\n\nWe're just getting started, thank you so much for your feedback it has helped us shape the future development of the game.",
