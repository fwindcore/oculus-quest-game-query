							"reviewDescription": "I was a bit hesitant to purchase this, the game looked \"fine\" in trailers and images, but the biggest thing that held me back was the guns looked...weak.  Bolters didn't seem chunky enough, Lasguns didnt seem \"pew\" enough and Meltas seemed more like a cigarette lighter than anything else.\n\nI went ahead and got it anyway finally, and I'm so happy I was wrong.  I can't stress enough that the game feels so much better to play yourself in VR than just watching a video.  As a 40k fan, when I first got to pickup and fire a Bolter I couldn't help but smile and say out loud \"Oh ho ho..BABY!\"  And they look amazing too.\n\nHowever I do have the same complaint many people do, and that is the graphical inconsistencies.  Models for characters and weapons look beautiful.  Lighting is also pretty good.  But some of the environmental textures like walls or rocks look kind of...bad.  Game is still 5 star in my opinion, its super fun.  Just seems strange that you can look down at yourself and see this beautifully rendered Sister, but then look at a wall and feel like its a texture from 2004.",
