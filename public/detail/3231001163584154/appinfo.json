Most of the time by melee will not hit or cause damage. \n             Story is very confusing...I’d say this is more opinion based but I could not get a solid understanding of the story.\n             Graphics..don’t get me wrong, this game is beautiful looking however some things aren’t.\n\nI have no hate towards this game.\n\nThis is a understanding of what I did and didn’t like.",
