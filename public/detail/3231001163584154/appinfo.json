As a consequence of this, we need to reset leaderboards to ensure a level playing field for those chasing top scores, we apologise for the inconvenience of this.\n\nBug Fixes:\n\n- Environment Streaming Tweaks - to remove some environment pop in occurring.\n\n- General Stability Improvements - a series of bug fixes and improvements to increase overall game stability. This includes visual fixes, nav mesh fixes for stuck enemies and minor bugs found by the community.\n\nWe will continue to refine and update the experience of Battle Sister based on community feedback and reports in future updates.

							"reviewDescription": "I'd like to preface that I love 40k, I play Sisters of Battle (Custom order \"Daughters of Kathrine\" offshoot of bloody rose)\n\nI was hyped as hell to play thi the visuals looked meh, but as a quest owner I acknowledge that visuals are going to be downgraded and that does not bother me. Its the gameplay, im about an hour in and the gameplay just seems very.... mediocre, nothing really makes it feel warhammer so far.\n\nThe audio also lacks that oomph, the bolters lack that thud feeling, the PC game Space Marine nailed it.\n\nThe sword play has no collisions and the faith push is boring.\n\nI know it sounds like I hate it, and I dont, quite the contrary, maybe its the fanboy in me or what but I'd give this a 3, 4 if you like warhammer.\n\nAlso the titans in the beginning are laughably small, and for god sake READ THE LORE ABOUT MELTA GUNS! THEY ARNT PLASMA SHOTGUNS THEY SHOOT A BEAM! Why do you think they have 12\" and a 24\" fu**ing range in the game.... Jesus christ. \n\nBut overall if you arny a fan of warhammer then its a 2.5 or a 3. If you like warhammer its a 3.5-4ish\n\nI toyed with returning it but I won't for 2 reasons, 1 I want to support more games coming to VR and especially quest (best of both worlds, standalone and VD full wierless PCVR) and 2nd I still enjoying spouting Ecclesiarchy nonsense while I play.\n\n5 the emperor!\n\nEDIT: Thats awesome the devs are reading these reviews and glad they are taking constructive criticism. After playing a bit more the above still stands but I've noticed a few more things.\n\nI'm right on the cusp of 5'9\" and 5'10\", but man, I TOWER over the other Sisters, the auto scale thing tries to tell me I'm 5 foot tall, so I think somewhere might be messed up.\n\nAlso no smooth turning or sprint is a little annoying, snap turning actually gives me a headache for some reason. Theres a teleport which kindof acts like a run, but no like charge or sprint option.\n\nI rely hope there's a chain sword (power sword it cool and all, but.... power sword... Make it the Benifice or something sweet)\n\nBut honestly its just lacking something to make it feel rediculous and over the top like warhammer does, the audio doesent to it justice either. \n\nMy above review still stands, I should also state that I wasn't dire ting the Melta gun at the devs specifically but it seems like every game puts meltaguns as a close range shotgun like weapon.\n\nFrom the 40k wiki\n\"The Meltagun, also called a \"Fusion Gun,\" \"Melter,\" or \"Cooker,\" is a powerful, short-ranged anti-armour weapon that produces an intense, energetic beam of heat in the tens of thousands of degrees Centigrade.\"",
