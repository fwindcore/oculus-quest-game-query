Kept me interested and wasn’t looking for anything heavy. Bigger assortment of guns would be nice.\nShame there is no way to avoid being shot at. That needs to be improved.\nOverall a good game and some nostalgia there from real like warhammer. Think it’s worth a purchase. For the price I think it’s over but I managed a discount so made more sense when the price was reduced",
