Prefer a one-handed grip? Two-handed? It’s up to you! And remember – this affects your strike power and accuracy, too.\n- Player interactions with enemies have been completely redesigned. The enemy now reacts not only to being shot, but also to melee weapon interactions, weapon stock interactions, and even bare-handed interactions.\n- You can knock down enemies and then beat them to death.\n- Enemy reaction physics have changed: all interactions with enemies now look more realistic.\n- Gameplay has been completely rebalanced. You wanted more headshots; we delivered.\n- We introduce a modified and improved enemy type – the Mask.\n- A new attack type has been added: bite.\n- Game sounds have been modified and improved.\n- Visual elements associated with enemies have been improved.",

							"reviewDescription": "I have been playing this for a week and really enjoying it. It's extremely simple in execution, and yet keeps me on my toes, spinning around in my living room watching behind me (when I can!).\n\nYesterday I died on the last level, so I shut down and came back today to finish it. As soon as it loaded I noticed a baseball bat in a locker. Hmmm... Never seen one before. The there was a wrench, and a pipe, and rebar I think... Anyways. I do love how you can put a melee weapon on your back. Really like that. I'll echo another comment I saw here - the baseball bat feels like a pool noodle. Whereas the wrench felt solid for me.\n\nI ended up just not using any melee weapons at all since they aren't as fast as killing zombies most of the time. Except for once I knocked a zombies head straight off with one hit and that was great!\n\nI do want to mention crawling through the vents. I love that - but the issue I have is it's near impossible to draw a gun out of a holster when doing that - if you spot a zombie down in a room - it's too hard to draw a gun to take him out stealth like. My guns are rattling around below the surface of the vent. I had to stand on my tippy toes to finally get it to work. Not sure if that can be tweaked somehow.\n\nMy only other issue is if I have 2 handguns, a keycard, and a rifle - then I pick up a shotgun and use that in my hands - when I reload it - it drops my rifle and I lose that. I usually like to pick up the shotgun, use it for what ammo I have then I just want to throw it away and pull off my rifle. \n\nHowever - all that nitpicking aside - this - is 'the' game I had imagined when I bought my Quest. It's simple, the graphics work well. I don't quite get the story - if there is one lol - but it's given me some good jump scares. For the $ - it's easily a MUST BUY.\n\nThanks to the devs for continuing to support it. Will be recommending to others and trying Co-op soon!",
