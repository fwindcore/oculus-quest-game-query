Prefer a one-handed grip? Two-handed? It’s up to you! And remember – this affects your strike power and accuracy, too.\n- Player interactions with enemies have been completely redesigned. The enemy now reacts not only to being shot, but also to melee weapon interactions, weapon stock interactions, and even bare-handed interactions.\n- You can knock down enemies and then beat them to death.\n- Enemy reaction physics have changed: all interactions with enemies now look more realistic.\n- Gameplay has been completely rebalanced. You wanted more headshots; we delivered.\n- We introduce a modified and improved enemy type – the Mask.\n- A new attack type has been added: bite.\n- Game sounds have been modified and improved.\n- Visual elements associated with enemies have been improved.",
