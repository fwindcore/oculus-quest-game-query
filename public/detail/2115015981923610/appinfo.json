Prefer a one-handed grip? Two-handed? It’s up to you! And remember – this affects your strike power and accuracy, too.\n- Player interactions with enemies have been completely redesigned. The enemy now reacts not only to being shot, but also to melee weapon interactions, weapon stock interactions, and even bare-handed interactions.\n- You can knock down enemies and then beat them to death.\n- Enemy reaction physics have changed: all interactions with enemies now look more realistic.\n- Gameplay has been completely rebalanced. You wanted more headshots; we delivered.\n- We introduce a modified and improved enemy type – the Mask.\n- A new attack type has been added: bite.\n- Game sounds have been modified and improved.\n- Visual elements associated with enemies have been improved.",

The graphics are completely amazing, kind of like Gorn. The weapon mechanics, albeit a little weird sometimes, work fairly well. I like how when you wield a gun, it shows a little red dot as to where your bullet will land. The melee mechanics are great, and I really feel like the more I put into my swing, the larger the damage is on the zombie. I like how there are multiple different kinds of zombies, which adds a good variation to the game. And above all else...\n\nI just love the hilarious Developer Responses on the 1 star reviews.\nBut being completely legitimate, one of the best VR games I’ve ever played.",
