The game runs great, plenty to do, still very addictive and lots of fun.\n\nWell worth buying! 5 out of 5 stars!!!\n\nORIGINAL: I've played a large range of games growning up ranging from the old light gun games on the Sinclair ZX Spectrum, Die Hard 2 on the PlayStation, Time Crisis and other arcade games... so when I saw Zombieland: Headshot Fever I thought I knew what I was going to expect, a quick play and then nothing more... Boy was I wrong!\n\nTo say I'm hooked would be selling it short. You'll find your self playing levels over and over just trying to scrape precious seconds off your time just to reach higher on the leaderboards.\n\nThe artstyle is a delight and the game runs very well on the Quest 2 standalone and when hooked up to the PC. The game supports Cross-buy and is well worth the price tag.\n\nI hope in future other courses/levels are added.\n\nIf you're looking for a light gun shooter that will keep you coming back for more, you owe it to yourself to grab this game!",
