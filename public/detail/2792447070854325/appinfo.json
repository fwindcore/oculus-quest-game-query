							"body_text": "Hello everyone!\n\nFirstly, a huge thank you to all our players! We hope you continue to enjoy Zombieland: Headshot Fever as we work hard to refine and improve the game!\n\nThis first patch addresses some of the issues you've told us about since last week's launch.\n\nBut it doesn't stop there. We're already hard at work on our second patch which will bring further quality of life improvements and other fixes, so stay tuned for that.\n\nThanks to all those that have already sent in their feedback, and thanks to everyone who has played and reviewed our game. It means the world.\n\nWe're always listening to our community, so head over to our Discord at discord.gg/zombielandvr to let us know what else you'd like to see in future updates.\n\nAnd with that out of the way, here are the patch notes:\n\nFor this patch (1.2.4):\n\n- Rank times for all levels have been tweaked. It’s now a little easier to get C Ranks (mission target time), but it’s harder to get S Ranks - the quality of your play has been astounding!\n- The amount of missions required to get respect and earn gun rewards / unlock the Zombieland Invitational has been reduced. We want you to become leaderboard-competitive as quickly as possible!\n- The Z-Hunter revolver has been buffed for balance reasons. The adrenaline generated by the Z-Hunter on high combos now lasts slightly longer (+150ms~300ms).\n- Both SMGs (Zippy and B90) have been buffed. The adrenaline slowdown effect has been increased by 5% in both cases. Remember, SMGs trigger adrenaline on any kill, not just headshots, making them great for crowd-clearing without dropping your combo.\n- The stun effect when being hit by a projectile has been reduced. You’ll be blind for less time - but watch out, because the zombies still advance more quickly while you’re stunned!\n- Gun control using two hands to stabilise (keep your left hand empty and bring the controllers together) has been increased in efficiency, meaning your bullet spray is reduced further in this mode. It’s better now!\n- Some GUI improvements have been implemented. Specifically, leaderboards now show more competitors; tooltips have been added to the level select interface; animations have been improved on the end-run screen; and texts have been altered to better express game mechanics throughout the game.\n- All levels have received a polish pass, resulting in improved collisions and more consistent zombie behaviour.\n- Milo, the final boss, has been improved with animation and timing tweaks.\n- Dialogues have been improved and added.\n- Subtitles have been improved.\n- The final cutscene has been improved.\n- The credits have been improved.\n- Bugs have been chased down and headshotted wherever possible.",

Zombieland Headshot Fever defies that trend & offers a solid light gun shooter (think House of the Dead or Time Crisis) for VR. Your initial temptation might be to compare this one with Arizona Sunshine or Walking Dead but Zombieland isn't trying to compete with those games. It knows what it is & its a whole load of arcade, head blasting fun that offers enough content & replayability (especially if you like chasing the high score on the leaderboards) to more than justify the asking price 👍🏻\n\nhttps://youtu.be/BBiIkM3j62U",
