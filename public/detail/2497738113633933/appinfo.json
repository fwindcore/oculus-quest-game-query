							"body_text": "Hey everyone,\n\nIn honor of Black History Month, we’ve added a new Bigscreen Movie category called Black Cinema with titles such as Night Catches Us, The Long Walk Home, St. Louis Superman, The Pruitt-Igoe Myth, and more to commemorate the accomplishments of African Americans in every area of endeavor throughout our history.\n\nThese are ad-supported free movies on Pluto.tv, and can be watched on-demand at any time in any of our environments including our new Drive-In Movie Theater!\n\nCheck out 13 more amazing films in the Free to Watch with Ads category such as The King’s Speech, Memento, and more.\n\nWe’re also hosting a live event on Monday, February 1st at 7PM PT/10PM ET, broadcasting Selma, Ava DuVernay’s critically acclaimed film. This is a live, social experience, offering – a unique way for VR users to watch a thought-provoking film with people around the country.\n\nNominated for Best Picture at the Academy Awards in 2014, Selma is the story of how Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. led a three month march from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama in 1965, fighting for equal voting rights for all Black Americans.\n\nCan't make it to the live event? We'll have more Selma events scheduled throughout the month. You are also able to rent Selma on-demand at any time at https://bigscreenvr.com/movies/catalog for $3.99 in the US/$4.99 in Canada.\n\nTo contribute and make a difference, please visit https://blacklivesmatter.com/\n\nAs always, we’re still working on some major updates for this year, including a new video/audio streaming technology, larger room sizes, ultra-low latency Remote Desktop streaming for Quest users, support for YouTube and streaming services, and a Friends System.\n\nTo contribute and make a difference, please visit https://blacklivesmatter.com/\n\nShare your feedback with us on these new changes, features you’re looking for, and issues/bugs you experience! Let us know in our 17,000-person Bigscreen Community Discord or if email us directly at support@bigscreenvr.com.\n\n#️⃣ Version: 0.107.0.8c2a1c-beta-ui-2020",

							"created_time": 1611186771,
							"body_text": "NASA’s Mars Perseverance rover makes its final descent to the Red Planet on Thursday, Feb. 18, 2021, at 11:15AM PT/2:15PM ET!\n\nPerseverance will touch down on Mars at approximately 12:30PM PT (3:30PM ET). During landing, the rover plunges through the thin Martian atmosphere, with the heat shield first, at a speed of over 12,000 mph (about 20,000 kph). A parachute and powered descent slow the rover down to about 2 mph (three-fourths of a meter per second). A large sky crane then lowers the rover on three bridle cords to land softly on six wheels.\n\nThe rover’s new home is Jezero Crater, a large impact crater about 28 miles wide (45 kilometers wide) just north of the Martian equator. Jezero once contained a lake, which scientists think is one of the most ideal places to find evidence of ancient microbial life. If life exists anywhere else in our solar system, chances are, it might be at Jezero Crater. The main question Perseverance is trying to answer is: Was there ever ancient life on Mars? To answer that question, the rover will collect and store the most compelling rock and soil samples for return to Earth by a future mission. Once on Earth, scientists can use a variety of sophisticated instruments, many of them too large and bulky to transport to Mars, to help answer this question.\n\nLanding on Mars is hard. Only about 40 percent of the missions ever sent to Mars – by any space agency – have been successful. Perseverance is only the fifth rover to attempt landing on Mars.\n\nWatch this event live in Bigscreen! A dedicated channel will be Featured in Bigscreen when the stream goes live! You can also find the channel under TV > To Infinity and Beyond category.\n\nOnce you launch Bigscreen, tap on TV to find the channel! Don't fret if you don't see the channel yet - it simply means the stream hasn't gone live yet! Join our community on Discord at https://discord.gg/bigscreen!",

							"reviewDescription": "I love Bigscreen, it’s definitely one of my favorite apps on VR. But I’m a little disappointed with inability to share movies. I can pay money to see one of the featured movies with a friend, but if I want to invite a friend over to my virtual living room to watch one of my movies on my server, it won’t work. My friend has to have that same movie on their server. Why? What would be the point in that? Maybe I’m doing something wrong, I’ve tried to see if there’s a workaround for this. So far, nothing. But if you can collaborate and share your files on your pc in a work related setting on Bigscreen, why couldn’t I watch a movie with a friend who doesn’t have the same movie? They can’t record it, download it...it’s not breaking any laws. It’s no different than buying the movie at a store, taking it home and watching it with my friends there. During this quarantine, my friends and I have been finding out what movies we haven’t seen and watching them. It would have been nice to share a movie with friend that I have, that they don’t have. Just hoping this is something that gets fixed. It doesn’t make sense and makes the whole idea of watching movies with friends limited to purchasing tickets for one of the handful of movies I really have no interest in seeing. Maybe if they played newly released movies that would be in the theaters, that would be better. I’d probably do that more often.",
