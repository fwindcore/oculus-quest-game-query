We hope that through their technology our game will allow you to not only see the afterlife experience but to feel it on your own skin.\n\nVR technology is still new and developing and we think that it is accessories such as haptic suits that set its milestones. bHaptics created a TactSuit - wireless haptic vest that packs multiple individually controllable vibro-tactile motors with positional haptic feedback delivered to every corner of your body. Thanks to bHaptics this kind of technology is no longer reserved for sci-fi movies, but is now available to a wider group of users.\n\nFor an adrenaline pumping VR game like In Death: Unchained where you can get shot, thrown at with an axe, fireballed and more, support for this type of technology is a natural next step. A high-quality haptic suit shall provide an immersive, extremely real even though still virtual experience.\n\n\nLet us know if you like it!",

							"reviewDescription": "You will lose hours of your life for months and maybe years. I own over 30 games, over ten are five star games and this deserves six stars. Ignore any negative reviews. Been playing everyday for over a month and haven’t even beaten the first level. Yet I am compelled to keep playing because I know I will! Fun, addictive never boring. Oh and yeah make the shard a short sword for teleporting and close combat. \n\nUpdate 3/30/21 Finally beat the pit of perdition and did so without taking a hit so I unlocked the orphans. Been playing this game almost daily for two months and haven’t even scratched the surface yet. So I have more time on this game than any in my library and I played robo recall, super hot, drop dead, lies beneath and all the zombie games for hours. That says a lot. The most bang for your buck of any game out there. Still have to beat the first boss anikim. Why is it so fun? Well you have stealth sniping, bait and lure tactics plus brutal in your face combat. You develop your own strategies and learn from your mistakes. Such a satisfying addictive game. Thank you devs. If I could own only one game this would be it.\nUpdate 4/10/21 Finally beat Anakim. Used balls of lightning on him while dispatching his minions with cataclysms. Worked really well. Had one issue where I became stuck in one of the cages in the pit. Don’t even know how ended up inside. Couldn’t teleport out and I had killed everything. Kinda sucked that I had to quit the run. \nUpdate: 4/23/21 still playing daily. Beat Anikim 6 times. He’s a big sissy. Tip - unload incursion bombs in front of him or load him up with lightning balls or both before you jump down. Then hit with all you got and he goes down in seconds. Also completed Purgatory in under 26 minutes which unlocked The Abyss\nUpdate 5/10/21 So addictive. Still playing daily and exclusively five months in. Beat Gabriel, scored over 266 headshots looted 24,000 gold tonight. The achievements keep racking up and my skill keeps improving. Tips: Become a master at headshots and teleporting around and you will do well. Be strategic in your attacks. Take out Cupid’s early with Tempest.",
