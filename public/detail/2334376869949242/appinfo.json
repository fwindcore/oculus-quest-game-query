We hope that through their technology our game will allow you to not only see the afterlife experience but to feel it on your own skin.\n\nVR technology is still new and developing and we think that it is accessories such as haptic suits that set its milestones. bHaptics created a TactSuit - wireless haptic vest that packs multiple individually controllable vibro-tactile motors with positional haptic feedback delivered to every corner of your body. Thanks to bHaptics this kind of technology is no longer reserved for sci-fi movies, but is now available to a wider group of users.\n\nFor an adrenaline pumping VR game like In Death: Unchained where you can get shot, thrown at with an axe, fireballed and more, support for this type of technology is a natural next step. A high-quality haptic suit shall provide an immersive, extremely real even though still virtual experience.\n\n\nLet us know if you like it!",

							"reviewDescription": "🤦‍♂️Just realised I had suggested that if you have low health don’t bother trying to take out the first Boss , just quit. Sorry , NOT quit the game itself but quit trying to take him out. DO go into his lair , to take some extra points , Die and keep your achievements for that session.\n\nOriginal review.\n\nLive, Die , Repeat.\nSimple.\n\nBut it takes some stamina and grit and determination to just keep going back in , but you do.\nI have , after many , many days , unlocked the next level. You genuinely feel you have worked flipping hard to get there and you bellow with true glory and success at the end of the first part. \nCan you progress as a beginner , oh yes you can . It is your destiny to do so. This is VR and this is a brutal lesson in full immersive gameplay , strategy and technique. It’s what we all wanted is it not ?\n\nSo how can you hope to survive ? ,\n\nGet high onto roof tops, scout out cover , stay at a distance wherever possible.\nStart high , work your way down.\nWhen you are ready ,drop down , get behind them. They hesitate , you hit. Get back on a roof top quick. \nPlan your escape. High-Low-High-Low , confuses the hell out of them.\n\nShoot down into doorways and windows to tease them out , they are idiots and run to where your arrow hits the ground. They look around , hesitate. They die.\nSend special arrows into corridors from outside first , clears the “air” as they all get caught up in ricochet and multiple explosions.\n\nHit every visible enemy at least once each. They stumble , you hit them again. They die. Weaken them from afar and teleport into the middle of them , headshot at close quarters , they die.\n\nMake all the hooded monks come to you , they are arrogant , they wail at you when they arrive. You don’t hesitate. Headshot. They die. Remind them NEVER to come that close to you , ever.\n\nUse the rocks and ice covered ground. Knights and Gouls don’t appear to jump or climb. They stand staring at you. They die. Simple.\nYou can do a lot of damage from outside the Save Towers. Taunt them and get them onto the bridges and walkways. Go high. They Die.\nAim to stand on parapets and walls , gives you an edge as they run at you\n\nUse the flaming arrows and ball of lightning arrows to weaken large groups. NEVER EVER jump down into a nest of the buggers. YOU DIE.\nBall of Lightning arrows mess with their minds and weakens . Pick them off. You are John Wick of Hell, remember this.\n\nKnights are good at protecting themselves with shields. So , hit their legs instead , strike their arms too.\n\nYou can beat the first Boss. You can. Have full quiver of the most deadly arrows possible , explosive too. Need FULL health . Get it , buy it.\nOnly go in to his lair with full health. Hit him quickly in the head. Dodge around with your teleport arrow, get behind the buggers. Don’t breathe just shoot.\n\nFinal time , no 6 , I had 75 Cataclysm III arrows and 2 Holy Armour upgrades , he dropped like a bowling pin in fairly quick time . Had to stay close to him and fire rapidly.\nOther equally deadly combinations of arrow do work but explosive properties are potent.\nIt gets easier ( ? ) as you gain more achievements and therefore more powerful arrows so patience required.\n\nGo direct to his lair IF you at full strength , avoid the hassle  of the ruins before-hand , nothing is gained running around here like a loon. You loose health and it’s a long walk back to a tower.\nIF your health is already low , mop up in the ruins and quit while ahead . Go to his lair just to chalk up some extra points and keep your achievements gained that session.\n\nYou practice , you learn , you master.\nLive Die Repeat .\n\nAnd then there is Paradise , oh boy ! It starts all over again but now they are much grumpier and very , very keen to kill you.\nHa, Ha , Ha bring it on yer buggers.\n\nThis is a true VR game , in fact a superbly crafted game in any format , of the highest calibrate and the developers have set the stage  for a classic that will be remembered , enjoyed , and played for a long time. \n\nGet it , and get stuck in.\n\n🏹 ( no more edits , promise 💕)",
