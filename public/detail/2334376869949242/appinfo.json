We hope that through their technology our game will allow you to not only see the afterlife experience but to feel it on your own skin.\n\nVR technology is still new and developing and we think that it is accessories such as haptic suits that set its milestones. bHaptics created a TactSuit - wireless haptic vest that packs multiple individually controllable vibro-tactile motors with positional haptic feedback delivered to every corner of your body. Thanks to bHaptics this kind of technology is no longer reserved for sci-fi movies, but is now available to a wider group of users.\n\nFor an adrenaline pumping VR game like In Death: Unchained where you can get shot, thrown at with an axe, fireballed and more, support for this type of technology is a natural next step. A high-quality haptic suit shall provide an immersive, extremely real even though still virtual experience.\n\n\nLet us know if you like it!",
