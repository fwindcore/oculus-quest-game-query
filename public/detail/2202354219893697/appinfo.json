Fight your way through waves of responsive targets, samurai, and highly dangerous ninjas - all while drawing, nocking, and shooting your arrows as quickly as possible. \n\nHolopoint is a skill based game where progression is based on player skill and training rather than unlocks. Like many arcade style games, personal progress and a high score is the goal. This game quickly becomes difficult and requires an active mindset. Holopoint is designed so that only a few determined archers will reach the last wave.\n\nWARNING: THIS GAME GETS INTENSE. REMEMBER TO BREATH AND TAKE BREAKS.",

The new visuals have much more detail but retain the simple and clean Holopoint look.\n• A new location, the Garden, has been opened and features thirty new waves as well as new targets. The Garden offers its own leaderboard to progress and focuses on more intense movements such as squatting.\n• Updated high contrast health display boards are easier to see and offer more clarity. When the player takes a hit the high contrast health boards slide to reveal a bright red color, warning the player that they have been hit.\n• New tatami mats help center the player in the play-space.\n• Cube holograms have been refreshed for an improved look \n• The main menu has been updated with game mode and location selection buttons.\n• A new Auto Quiver option allows players to automatically draw arrows without the use of the quiver. In practice this option does not offer much of a score advantage if any but does allow players to opt-out of the quiver requirement and greatly helps those who find this movement difficult.\n• The quiver has been adjusted to avoid unintentional arrow draws while still maintaining accurate arrow drawing when moving. The quiver now requires more precise movement of the hand to the side of the head to draw an arrow.\n• A new Floating Score Announcements option reveals point values in the air where targets are defeated. Orange values are shown when full points are awarded for a target, and blue values are shown when less points are awarded. No score value is shown if no score was awarded.\n• Improved high-speed arrow physics allows for more accurate collision detection in rare cases where targets may have previously not been detected.\n• A new audio manager plays different music tracks depending on current game state (idle vs in-game tracks).\n• Many bug fixes are also included for an overall better experience.",

							"reviewDescription": "If you like VR archery but you also want some exercise, then this is definitely the game for you. You're almost constantly in motion, ducking, dodging, and twisting to avoid a onslaught of of targets. It's a lot of fun, but exhausting. I started two weeks ago and could only manage about 30 minutes, now I'm up to an hour and on wave 28/30... it's pretty addictive, albeit very simple gameplay. It's more about speed than anything else. If you're looking for something about accuracy or range, this is probably not the game for you : speed and body movement are everything. I would say it's definitely exercise-oriented. \n\nThough simple, the variety and randomisation of targets is sufficient to keep it interesting. The level difficulty is slightly non-linear, which keeps the feeling of progress and stops you getting exhausted too quickly. There's not much in the way of instruction, which occasionally makes things confusing, but things are generally simple enough to learn that you can figure it out for yourself. My biggest frustration was finding the sweet spot for loading the arrow, but once you've got that, things become a great deal easier.\n\nThere's definite scope for improvement here. More, much stronger haptic feedback would help (seriously, the bow-drawing haptic in Elven Assassin is perfect, why hasn't anyone else imitated that ?), especially to tell if you've drawn an arrow and if you've been hit. Better sound to give more cues as to where the targets are would also help, as would having a variety of music.\n\nAll in all it's very solid if you're sick of sitting around like a couch potato all day, but somewhat limited if you're more interested in gameplay.\n\nEDIT : Bumped up my rating to 5 stars following a VERY nice graphical update plus a whole new game mode. In my opinion this now makes it excellent value for money. Great to see it's still in development ! I play it daily for exercise and it's very effective.",
