							"reviewDescription": "Demon Woman: if you see her don’t look at her, she hates that. If you do look at her she will chase you for about 30 seconds. If you manage to find a room with a door go in there, close the door behind you. Demon lady can’t break down doors. She will spawn at random. You see her 1-2 times each game ( unless you manage to beat the game fast)\n\nShadow folk: these guys are simple but complicated at the same time. They will emerge from the ground and stare at you for 10 seconds at most. They have multiple behavior patterns, including ( staring and melting) (staring, screaming then melting) (staring, screaming, erratically inching towards you with ever scream, melting.) Shadow folk like to spawn in the corners of rooms. Try your best not to go to far into rooms, for it is easy for them to spawn.\n\nWatch dogs: these huge, scared up dogs patrol the long and wide halls. If you encounter a watch dog make sure to run into a narrow hallway for the watch dog can’t fit.\n\nStatues/gargoyles: statues are fairly easy to avoid. You can touch them as much as you want. These statue are mostly just for a scare, they don’t ( at least I think) kill. If you see one and you look away from them so their not in your peripheral vision they will teleport fairly close to you. Once again, it’s mostly just to scare you. I don’t think they can actually kill you. I don’t know, try it yourself.\n\nBlind Claw Creature: these creatures are blind.... sorta. If you encounter one turn of your light. They can’t see you that way. If you have your light off you can get as close as possible if you want. Don’t run away into a closed of room with a door for they can break down doors.\n\nFloating Head: these creatures float out of wells. If you see one don’t panic, don’t move. They attack if they see movement. The only time you can move is if you see the back of his head (back of head is red and bloody)",
