But when we found this game it was and is incredible. Our son who has adhd (bad) loves to be the tree and defend his acorns. Tires him out. Our daughter who has a couple different abilities loves to play and not feel like she’s less of a person cause she’s not at the bigger kids level. Last night our grandson tried (4yo) and picked up both sides of the game fast. He loved being the tree the most. But the most amazing thing is our daughter and her family can be the squirrels at their home and we just be on speakers. So in this pandemic we’re all in and having different shut downs across the planet we can still connect and have a blast. HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS. Even our teenagers play with their younger siblings and my husband, who would rather be in the garage will stop and come play.",
