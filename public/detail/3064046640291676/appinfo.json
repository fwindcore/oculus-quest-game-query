							"reviewDescription": "First off, Swords of gargantua is a very enjoyable game, despite the critisms in this review.  Swinging weapons in VR is awesome, and most weapons in swords of gargantua are reasonably balanced.  I recommend it to anyone who wants a hack n slash VR game. \nI have 4 criticisms:\n1. Communication errors are horrible and frequent.\n2. Too many things lead to making it an attack-centric game\n3.  The tesseract abyss sword takes so long to get copies to strengthen that most players do not use it.\n4. Combo boost and enchanted attack up need to be much stronger for players to ever pick them over attack up in levelling up.\nRecommendations:\n1. An endless survivor mode that can be saved midway through where players can use their adventure mode weapons would be amazing in this game.  It could be identical to adventure mode, but not have the gargantua fight, and could be paused/saved to be returned to/ every so many floors, so that headset battery life does not limit advancement (though defeat would still reset back to a starting floor, maybe starting at later floors could be unlockable or something)  thus, floors could continually get harder with more enemies. (I dont think there is any floor other than 101 with more than 1 elite soldier at a time).\n2. Have players keep their blessings/curses and coins accrued in an adventure run if they leave a room and come back.  This will make communication errors less disastrous.\n3. Instead of needing to do 4 of 5 conditions on the gargantua fight to get tesseract abyss sword, players should just get more tesseract abyss swords for fufilling more of the conditions.  This will still reward players for fufilling the conditions, while not making it seem like a grind to get the 40+ tesseract swords needed to get a +10 tesseract abyss sword\n4. getting weapons should be a bit less random and bit more action-based.  \n\nI can elaborate on any of these points if it is desired for me to do so.",
