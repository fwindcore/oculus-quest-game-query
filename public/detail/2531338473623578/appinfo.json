Playing in a multiplayer game will unlock our new Black/Pink uniform combo, and for any players who reach sector 5 (it's really quite easy), you will unlock our Orange/White Commander's Uniform. Once unlocked, these are yours to keep!\n\nAs an added bonus, all players will also have access to our new playable alien species, pictured below. You will be able to select this look from May 21st onwards, even if you don't manage to make it to our birthday weekend event.\n\nBalloons!\n\nWe've added some party balloons around the bridge of the ship, just to mark the occasion.\n\nKeep your eyes open for some exciting announcements coming from the Spaceteam Crew over the next few days - we have lots to talk about in the very near future!\n\nSee you on the bridge, and remember.......... work together as a space team!\n\n\n",

I can play in English but French is my 1st language and the iOS French version is sooooo hilarious. \nDevelopers please translate tout game on the Qu’este too",
