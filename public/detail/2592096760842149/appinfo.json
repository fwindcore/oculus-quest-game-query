							"body_text": "Hello all!  We've got several updates and an announcement to cover for our big May update, so without further ado, let's get started!\n\n\n\nFirst and foremost, we're happy to announce a major accessibility addition:  the new Height Slider will let players adjust their in-game height to provide a more optimal experience.  And yes, this is also designed to provide a better experience for seated players as well!\n\n\n\nWe've also added some fun new additions to the end-game celebrations!  Take out your frustrations (or, er, share in the victory) with your teammates in new and explosive ways!  This now carries over to players 'hanging out' in the practice field (in other words, target practice!)\n\n\n\nManual receiver mode has also gotten a significant update - Whenever you become the ball carrier (either via pass, hand-off or lateral), you'll get a temporary stat boost allowing you to run faster while the ball is in play, and your stiff-arm will be slightly stronger as well!\n\n\n\nBut wait, there's more!  We've completed a third substantial detail pass on EVERY field, enhancing the visuals and pushing the Quest platform further than before.\n\n\n\nWe've also improved stat tracking to be more accurate, as we head toward the end (hopefully) of our 2MD stats beta!  For that reason, we're going to be implementing another BIG change this summer: It's become clear after updating the mechanics and adding manual receiver mode, the current leaderboards are woefully out of date!  For this reason, we're announcing plans to RESET the leaderboards come June 1, 2021.  This will allow us to start fresh with a level playing field.\n\nWe've made SO many additions and updates to 2MD on #quest that it's quite literally double the game it used to be (seriously, it's doubled in size!).   It's honestly only because of your support that we've been able to continue updating 2MD: VR Football Unleashed. So thank you, from the bottom of our hearts, for your continued support, for spreading the word, and for most of all, for taking the time to play our game!",

							"created_time": 1616299325,
							"body_text": "\n\nHello all!\n\nIt's been a month since the last big update to 2MD: VR Football, and we're extremely humbled by the positive response that many of you have taken the time to share with us.  April is upon us, and with the new month comes a small but substantial gameplay update, along with another fun new addition!  So, without further ado, let's get started!\n\n\n\nManual Receiver Mode is Here!\n\nThat's right -- now you have the option of running the ball when you complete ANY pass or hand-off!  By toggling the new \"receiver mode\" slider in the locker room from \"CPU\" to \"Manual,\" any completed pass will instantaneously transport you to the target player with possession of the ball.\n\nAfter a brief 1 second pause to let you gather your bearings, the action resumes, and it'll be your job to run your route and stiff arm opponents along the way.\n\nWhen in manual receiver mode, your movement is faster than the default QB, although you still cannot flat outrun the defense -- the key here will be to design plays to minimize defensive coverage and create the ideal scenario for maximum yardage gains.  Stats will be adjusted to reflect rush gains and touchdowns for manual receiver mode as well.\n\n\n\nChampionship Stadium\n\nWe're also excited to reveal a new stadium addition to 2MD.  Championship field will now be revealed when you reach round 7, exclusively decked out for the championship game.\n\nLastly, we've made a few additional small updates and improvements to other stadiums in the game, along with some other behind the scenes improvements.\n\nYour support helps 2MD, and it really goes without saying that the best way to see the features you want to see is to spread the word and help us grow the game's audience so that we can continue to provide increasing levels of ongoing support.  \nIf you like 2MD, leave us a review, or reach out to us on twitter @truantpixel to tell us what you think!\n\nTake care, and as always, thanks for playing our game!",

This is the kind of game you can pick up for 10 mins and have some quick fun or run through a whole season. I feel like a QB when I play which is all you can ask for.\n\nAdditionally, and just as important, this game has great devs. I bought this game a few months ago and there has already been two major updates. I liked the game when I bought it and they keep giving me new reasons to play. I have other games I’ve purchased where it’s obvious the devs have moved on to something else. \n\nIf you have even a slight interest in this game you should buy",
